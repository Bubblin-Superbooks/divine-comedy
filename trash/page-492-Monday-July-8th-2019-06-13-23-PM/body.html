The Emperor of the kingdom dolorous
  From his mid-breast forth issued from the ice;
  And better with a giant I compare
Than do the giants with those arms of his;
  Consider now how great must be that whole,
  Which unto such a part conforms itself.
Were he as fair once, as he now is foul,
  And lifted up his brow against his Maker,
  Well may proceed from him all tribulation.
O, what a marvel it appeared to me,
