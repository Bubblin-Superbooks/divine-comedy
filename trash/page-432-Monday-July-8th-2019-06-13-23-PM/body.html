  As he who goeth yonder undertook,
That he might gain the lady of the herd,
  To counterfeit in himself Buoso Donati,
  Making a will and giving it due form."
And after the two maniacs had passed
  On whom I held mine eye, I turned it back
  To look upon the other evil-born.
I saw one made in fashion of a lute,
  If he had only had the groin cut off
  Just at the point at which a man is forked.
The heavy dropsy, that so disproportions
