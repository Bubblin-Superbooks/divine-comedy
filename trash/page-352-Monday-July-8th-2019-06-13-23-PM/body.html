  But that thou mayst not such a sight enjoy,
  If thou shalt e'er be out of the dark places,
Thine ears to my announcement ope and hear:
  Pistoia first of Neri groweth meagre;
  Then Florence doth renew her men and manners;
Mars draws a vapour up from Val di Magra,
  Which is with turbid clouds enveloped round,
  And with impetuous and bitter tempest
Over Campo Picen shall be the battle;
  When it shall suddenly rend the mist asunder,
