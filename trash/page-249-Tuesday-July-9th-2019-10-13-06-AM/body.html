  Who knew the art of moderate expenses,
And Niccolo, who the luxurious use

And taking out the band, among whom squandered
  Caccia d'Ascian his vineyards and vast woods,
  And where his wit the Abbagliato proffered!

  Against the Sienese, make sharp thine eye
  Tow'rds me, so that my face well answer thee,
And thou shalt see I am Capocchio's shade,
  Who metals falsified by alchemy;
  Thou must remember, if I well descry thee,
How I a skilful ape of nature was."</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
