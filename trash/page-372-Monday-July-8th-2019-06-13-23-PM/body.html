Then sorrowed I, and sorrow now again,
  When I direct my mind to what I saw,
  And more my genius curb than I am wont,
That it may run not unless virtue guide it;
  So that if some good star, or better thing,
  Have given me good, I may myself not grudge it.
As many as the hind (who on the hill
  Rests at the time when he who lights the world
  His countenance keeps least concealed from us,
While as the fly gives place unto the gnat)
