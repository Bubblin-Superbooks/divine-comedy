<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Canto Xxviii</h3><pre class=" stretch-last-line">Who ever could, e'en with untrammelled words,
  Tell of the blood and of the wounds in full
  Which now I saw, by many times narrating?
Each tongue would for a certainty fall short
  By reason of our speech and memory,
  That have small room to comprehend so much.
If were again assembled all the people
  Which formerly upon the fateful land
  Of Puglia were lamenting for their blood
Shed by the Romans and the lingering war
  That of the rings made such illustrious spoils,
  As Livy has recorded, who errs not,
With those who felt the agony of blows
  By making counterstand to Robert Guiscard,
  And all the rest, whose bones are gathered</pre></div> </div>
