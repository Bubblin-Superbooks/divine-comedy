  For I who saw it hardly can admit it.
As I was holding raised on them my brows,
  Behold! a serpent with six feet darts forth
  In front of one, and fastens wholly on him.

  And with the forward ones his arms it seized;
  Then thrust its teeth through one cheek and the other;
The hindermost it stretched upon his thighs,
  And put its tail through in between the two,
