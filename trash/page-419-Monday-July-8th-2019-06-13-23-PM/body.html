All the diseases in one moat were gathered,
  Such was it here, and such a stench came from it
  As from putrescent limbs is wont to issue.
We had descended on the furthest bank
  From the long crag, upon the left hand still,
  And then more vivid was my power of sight
Down tow'rds the bottom, where the ministress
  Of the high Lord, Justice infallible,
  Punishes forgers, which she here records.
I do not think a sadder sight to see
