  Perchance there where he ploughs and makes his vintage;
With flames as manifold resplendent all
  Was the eighth Bolgia, as I grew aware
  As soon as I was where the depth appeared.
And such as he who with the bears avenged him
  Beheld Elijah's chariot at departing,
  What time the steeds to heaven erect uprose,
For with his eye he could not follow it
  So as to see aught else than flame alone,
  Even as a little cloud ascending</pre></div> </div>
