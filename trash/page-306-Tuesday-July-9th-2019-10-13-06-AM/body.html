<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Canto Xxii</h3><pre class=" stretch-last-line">I have erewhile seen horsemen moving camp,
  Begin the storming, and their muster make,
  And sometimes starting off for their escape;
Vaunt-couriers have I seen upon your land,
  O Aretines, and foragers go forth,
  Tournaments stricken, and the joustings run,
Sometimes with trumpets and sometimes with bells,
  With kettle-drums, and signals of the castles,
