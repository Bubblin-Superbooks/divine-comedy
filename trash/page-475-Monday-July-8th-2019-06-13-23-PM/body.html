<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent stretch-last-line">death,
  Hear shalt thou, and shalt know if he has wronged me.
A narrow perforation in the mew,
  Which bears because of me the title of Famine,
  And in which others still must be locked up,
Had shown me through its opening many moons
  Already, when I dreamed the evil dream
  Which of the future rent for me the veil.
This one appeared to me as lord and master,
  Hunting the wolf and whelps upon the mountain
</pre></div> </div>
