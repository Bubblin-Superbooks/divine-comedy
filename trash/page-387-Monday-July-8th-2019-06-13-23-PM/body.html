  My voice, and who but now wast speaking Lombard,
  Saying, 'Now go thy way, no more I urge thee,'
Because I come perchance a little late,
  To stay and speak with me let it not irk thee;
  Thou seest it irks not me, and I am burning.
If thou but lately into this blind world
  Hast fallen down from that sweet Latian land,
  Wherefrom I bring the whole of my transgression,
Say, if the Romagnuols have peace or war,
