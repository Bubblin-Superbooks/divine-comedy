There it was less than night, and less than day,
  So that my sight went little in advance;
  But I could hear the blare of a loud horn,
So loud it would have made each thunder faint,
  Which, counter to it following its way,
  Mine eyes directed wholly to one place.
After the dolorous discomfiture
  When Charlemagne the holy emprise lost,
  So terribly Orlando sounded not.
Short while my head turned thitherward</pre></div> </div>
