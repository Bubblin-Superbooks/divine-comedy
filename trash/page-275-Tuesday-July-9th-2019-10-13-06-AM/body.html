Already we had gone away from him,
  When I beheld two frozen in one hole,
  So that one head a hood was to the other;
And even as bread through hunger is devoured,
  The uppermost on the other set his teeth,
  There where the brain is to the nape united.

  The temples of Menalippus in disdain,

"O thou, who showest by such bestial sign
  Thy hatred against him whom thou art eating,
  Tell me the wherefore," said I, "with this compact,
That if thou rightfully of him complain,
  In knowing who ye are, and his transgression,
  I in the world above repay thee for it,
If that wherewith I speak be not dried up."</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
