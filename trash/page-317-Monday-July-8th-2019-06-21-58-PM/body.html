  When I procure for mine a greater sadness."
Alichin held not in, but running counter
  Unto the rest, said to him: "If thou dive,
  I will not follow thee upon the gallop,
But I will beat my wings above the pitch;
  The height be left, and be the bank a shield
  To see if thou alone dost countervail us."
O thou who readest, thou shalt hear new sport!
  Each to the other side his eyes</pre></div> </div>
