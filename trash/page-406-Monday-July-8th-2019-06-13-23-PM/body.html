<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent stretch-last-line">condemn,
  And whom I once saw up in Latian land,
  Unless too great similitude deceive me,
Call to remembrance Pier da Medicina,
  If e'er thou see again the lovely plain
  That from Vercelli slopes to Marcabo,
And make it known to the best two of Fano,
  To Messer Guido and Angiolello likewise,
  That if foreseeing here be not in vain,
Cast over from their vessel shall they be,
  And drowned near unto the Cattolica,
