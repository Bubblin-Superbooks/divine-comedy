<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent stretch-last-line">Wretched Sabellus and Nassidius,
  And wait to hear what now shall be shot forth.
Be silent Ovid, of Cadmus and Arethusa;
  For if him to a snake, her to fountain,
  Converts he fabling, that I grudge him not;
Because two natures never front to front
  Has he transmuted, so that both the forms
  To interchange their matter ready were.
Together they responded in such wise,
  That to a fork the serpent cleft his tail,
  And eke the wounded drew his feet</pre></div> </div>
