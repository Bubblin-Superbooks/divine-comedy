<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent stretch-last-line">down,
  Or under quilt, one cometh not to fame,
Withouten which whoso his life consumes
  Such vestige leaveth of himself on earth,
  As smoke in air or in the water foam.
And therefore raise thee up, o'ercome the anguish
  With spirit that o'ercometh every battle,
  If with its heavy body it sink not.
A longer stairway it behoves thee mount;
  'Tis not enough from these to have departed;
  Let it avail thee, if thou understand</pre></div> </div>
