<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent stretch-last-line">The creature who once had the beauteous semblance,
He from before me moved and made me stop,
  Saying: "Behold Dis, and behold the place
  Where thou with fortitude must arm thyself."
How frozen I became and powerless then,
  Ask it not, Reader, for I write it not,
  Because all language would be insufficient.
I did not die, and I alive remained not;
  Think for thyself now, hast thou aught of wit,
  What I became, being of both</pre></div> </div>
