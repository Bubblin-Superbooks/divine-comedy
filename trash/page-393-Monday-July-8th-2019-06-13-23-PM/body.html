<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent stretch-last-line">To lower the sails, and coil away the ropes,
That which before had pleased me then displeased me;
  And penitent and confessing I surrendered,
  Ah woe is me! and it would have bestead me;
The Leader of the modern Pharisees
  Having a war near unto Lateran,
  And not with Saracens nor with the Jews,
For each one of his enemies was Christian,
  And none of them had been to conquer Acre,
  Nor merchandising in the Sultan's</pre></div> </div>
