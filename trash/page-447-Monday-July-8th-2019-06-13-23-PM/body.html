Because as on its circular parapets
  Montereggione crowns itself with towers,
  E'en thus the margin which surrounds the well
With one half of their bodies turreted

  E'en now from out the heavens when he thunders.

  Shoulders, and breast, and great part of the belly,
  And down along his sides both of the arms.
Certainly Nature, when she left the making
