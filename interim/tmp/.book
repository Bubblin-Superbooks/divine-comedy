After the dolorous discomfiture When Charlemagne the holy emprise lost, So terribly Orlando sounded not. Short while my head turned thitherward I held When many lofty towers I seemed to see, Whereat I: \"Master, say, what town is this?\" And he to me: \"Because thou peerest forth Athwart the darkness at too great a distance, It happens that thou errest in thy fancy.

Certainly Nature, when she left the making Of animals like these, did well indeed, By taking such executors from Mars; And if of elephants and whales she doth not Repent her, whosoever looketh subtly More just and more discreet will hold her for it; For where the argument of intellect Is added unto evil will and power, No rampart can the people make</pre>",
  "page-272": "<pre class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">against it.

What time the giants terrified the gods; The arms he wielded never more he moves.\" And I to him: \"If possible, I should wish That of the measureless Briareus These eyes of mine might have experience.\" Whence he replied: \"Thou shalt behold Antaeus Close by here, who can speak and is unbound, Who at the bottom of all crime shall place us.

Then was I more afraid of death than ever, For nothing more was needful than the fear, If I had not beheld the manacles. Then we proceeded farther in advance, And to Antaeus came, who, full five ells Without the head, forth issued from the cavern. \"O thou, who in the valley fortunate, Which Scipio the heir of glory made, When Hannibal turned back with all his hosts, Once brought'st a thousand lions for thy prey, And who, hadst thou been at the</pre>",

Still in the world can he restore thy fame; Because he lives, and still expects long life, If to itself Grace call him not untimely.\" So said the Master; and in haste the other His hands extended and took up my Guide,â€” Hands whose great pressure Hercules once felt.

As seems the Carisenda, to behold Beneath the leaning side, when goes a cloud Above it so that opposite it hangs; Such did Antaeus seem to me, who stood Watching to see him stoop, and then it was I could have wished to go some other way.
