almost where the ascent began,\n  A panther light and swift exceedingly,\n  Which with a spotted skin was covered o'er!\nAnd never moved she from before my face,\n  Nay, rather did impede so much my way,\n  That many times I to return had turned.\nThe time was the beginning of the morning,\n  And up the sun was mounting with those stars\n  That with him were, what time the Love Divine\nAt first in motion set those beauteous things;\n  So were to me occasion of good hope,\n  The variegated skin of that wild beast,\nThe hour of time, and the delicious season;\n  But not so much, that did not give me fear\n  A lion's aspect which appeared to me.\nHe seemed as if against me he were coming\n  With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger,\n  So that it seemed the air was afraid of him;\nAnd a she-wolf, that with all hungerings\n  Seemed to be laden in her meagreness,\n  And many folk has caused to live forlorn!\nShe brought upon me so much heaviness,\n  With the affright that from her aspect came,\n  That I the hope relinquished of the height.\nAnd as he is who willingly acquires,\n  And the time comes that causes him to lose,\n  Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent,\nE'en such made me that beast withouten peace,\n  Which, coming on against me by degrees\n  Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent.\nWhile I was rushing downward to the lowland,\n  Before mine eyes did one present himself,\n  Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse.\nWhen I beheld him in the desert vast,\n  \"Have pity on me,\" unto him I cried,\n  \"Whiche'er thou art, or shade or real man!\"\nHe answered me: \"Not man; man once I was,\n  And both my parents were of Lombardy,\n  And Mantuans by country both of them.\n'Sub Julio' was I born, though it was late,\n  And lived at Rome under the good Augustus,\n  During the time of false and lying gods.\nA poet was I, and I sang that just\n  Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy,\n  After that Ilion the superb was burned.\nBut thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance?\n  Why climb'st thou not the Mount Delectable,\n  Which is the source and cause of every joy?\"\n\"Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain\n  Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?\"\n  I made response to him with bashful forehead.\n\"O, of the other poets honour and light,\n  Avail me the long study and great love\n  That have impelled me to explore thy volume!\nThou art my master, and my author thou,\n  Thou art alone the one from whom I took\n  The beautiful style that has done honour to me.\nBehold the beast, for which I have turned back;\n  Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage,\n  For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble.\"\n\"Thee it behoves to take another road,\"\n  Responded he, when he beheld me weeping,\n  \"If from this savage place thou wouldst escape;\nBecause this beast, at which thou criest out,\n  Suffers not any one to pass her way,\n  But so doth harass him, that she destroys him;\nAnd has a nature so malign and ruthless,\n  That never doth she glut her greedy will,\n  And after food is hungrier than before.\nMany the animals with whom she weds,\n  And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound\n  Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain.\nHe shall not feed on either earth or pelf,\n  But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue;\n  'Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be;\nOf that low Italy shall he be the saviour,\n  On whose account the maid Camilla died,\n  Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;\nThrough every city shall he hunt her down,\n  Until he shall have driven her back to Hell,\n  There from whence envy first did let her loose.\nTherefore I think and judge it for thy best\n  Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide,\n  And lead thee hence through the eternal place,\nWhere thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations,\n  Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate,\n  Who cry out each one for the second death;\nAnd thou shalt see those who contented are\n  Within the fire, because they hope to come,\n  Whene'er it may be, to the blessed people;\nTo whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend,\n  A soul shall be for that than I more worthy;\n  With her at my departure I will leave thee;\nBecause that Emperor, who reigns above,\n  In that I was rebellious to his law,\n  Wills that through me none come into his city.\nHe governs everywhere, and there he reigns;\n  There is his city and his lofty throne;\n  O happy he whom thereto he elects!\"\nAnd I to him: \"Poet, I thee entreat,\n  By that same God whom thou didst never know,\n  So that I may escape this woe and worse,\nThou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,\n  That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,\n  And those thou makest so disconsolate.\"\nThen he moved on, and I behind him followed."

because they are not fearful.\nGod in his mercy such created me\n  That misery of yours attains me not,\n  Nor any flame assails me of this burning.\nA gentle Lady is in Heaven, who grieves\n  At this impediment, to which I send thee,\n  So that stern judgment there above is broken.\nIn her entreaty she besought Lucia,\n  And said, \"Thy faithful one now stands in need\n  Of thee, and unto thee I recommend him.\"\nLucia, foe of all that cruel is,\n  Hastened away, and came unto the place\n  Where I was sitting with the ancient Rachel.\n\"Beatrice\" said she, \"the true praise of God,\n  Why succourest thou not him, who loved thee so,\n  For thee he issued from the vulgar herd?\nDost thou not hear the pity of his plaint?\n  Dost thou not see the death that combats him\n  Beside that flood, where ocean has no vaunt?\"\nNever were persons in the world so swift\n  To work their weal and to escape their woe,\n  As I, after such words as these were uttered,\nCame hither downward from my blessed seat,\n  Confiding in thy dignified discourse,\n  Which honours thee, and those who've listened to it.'\nAfter she thus had spoken unto me,\n  Weeping, her shining eyes she turned away;\n  Whereby she made me swifter in my coming;\nAnd unto thee I came, as she desired;\n  I have delivered thee from that wild beast,\n  Which barred the beautiful mountain's short ascent.\nWhat is it, then?  Why, why dost thou delay?\n  Why is such baseness bedded in thy heart?\n  Daring and hardihood why hast thou not,\nSeeing that three such Ladies benedight\n  Are caring for thee in the court of Heaven,\n  And so much good my speech doth promise thee?\"\nEven as the flowerets, by nocturnal chill,\n  Bowed down and closed, when the sun whitens them,\n  Uplift themselves all open on their stems;\nSuch I became with my exhausted strength,\n  And such good courage to my heart there coursed,\n  That I began, like an intrepid person:\n\"O she compassionate, who succoured me,\n  And courteous thou, who hast obeyed so soon\n  The words of truth which she addressed to thee!\nThou hast my heart so with desire disposed\n  To the adventure, with these words of thine,\n  That to my first intent I have returned.\nNow go, for one sole will is in us both,\n  Thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Master thou.\"\n  Thus said I to him; and when he had moved,\nI entered on the deep and savage way."

and farther question not.\"\nThereat were quieted the fleecy cheeks\n  Of him the ferryman of the livid fen,\n  Who round about his eyes had wheels of flame.\nBut all those souls who weary were and naked\n  Their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together,\n  As soon as they had heard those cruel words.\nGod they blasphemed and their progenitors,\n  The human race, the place, the time, the seed\n  Of their engendering and of their birth!\nThereafter all together they drew back,\n  Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore,\n  Which waiteth every man who fears not God.\nCharon the demon, with the eyes of glede,\n  Beckoning to them, collects them all together,\n  Beats with his oar whoever lags behind.\nAs in the autumn-time the leaves fall off,\n  First one and then another, till the branch\n  Unto the earth surrenders all its spoils;\nIn similar wise the evil seed of Adam\n  Throw themselves from that margin one by one,\n  At signals, as a bird unto its lure.\nSo they depart across the dusky wave,\n  And ere upon the other side they land,\n  Again on this side a new troop assembles.\n\"My son,\" the courteous Master said to me,\n  \"All those who perish in the wrath of God\n  Here meet together out of every land;\nAnd ready are they to pass o'er the river,\n  Because celestial Justice spurs them on,\n  So that their fear is turned into desire.\nThis way there never passes a good soul;\n  And hence if Charon doth complain of thee,\n  Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports.\"\nThis being finished, all the dusk champaign\n  Trembled so violently, that of that terror\n  The recollection bathes me still with sweat.\nThe land of tears gave forth a blast of wind,\n  And fulminated a vermilion light,\n  Which overmastered in me every sense,\nAnd as a man whom sleep hath seized I fell.```\n\n---\n### Canto IV ```\nBroke the deep lethargy within my head\n  A heavy thunder, so that I upstarted,\n  Like to a person who by force is wakened;\nAnd round about I moved my rested eyes,\n  Uprisen erect, and steadfastly I gazed,\n  To recognise the place wherein I was.\nTrue is it, that upon the verge I found me\n  Of the abysmal valley dolorous,\n  That gathers thunder of infinite ululations.\nObscure, profound it was, and nebulous,\n  So that by fixing on its depths my sight\n  Nothing whatever I discerned therein.\n\"Let us descend now into the blind world,\"\n  Began the Poet, pallid utterly;\n  \"I will be first, and thou shalt second be.\"\nAnd I, who of his colour was aware,\n  Said: \"How shall I come, if thou art afraid,\n  Who'rt wont to be a comfort to my fears?\"\nAnd he to me: \"The anguish of the people\n  Who are below here in my face depicts\n  That pity which for terror thou hast taken.\nLet us go on, for the long way impels us.\"\n  Thus he went in, and thus he made me enter\n  The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss.\nThere, as it seemed to me from listening,\n  Were lamentations none, but only sighs,\n  That tremble made the everlasting air.\nAnd this arose from sorrow without torment,\n  Which the crowds had, that many were and great,\n  Of infants and of women and of men.\nTo me the Master good: \"Thou dost not ask\n  What spirits these, which thou beholdest, are?\n  Now will I have thee know, ere thou go farther,\nThat they sinned not; and if they merit had,\n  'Tis not enough, because they had not baptism\n  Which is the portal of the Faith thou holdest;\nAnd if they were before Christianity,\n  In the right manner they adored not God;\n  And among such as these am I myself.\nFor such defects, and not for other guilt,\n  Lost are we and are only so far punished,\n  That without hope we live on in desire.\"\nGreat grief seized on my heart when this I heard,\n  Because some people of much worthiness\n  I knew, who in that Limbo were suspended.\n\"Tell me, my Master, tell me, thou my Lord,\"\n  Began I, with desire of being certain\n  Of that Faith which o'ercometh every error,\n\"Came any one by his own merit hence,\n  Or by another's, who was blessed thereafter?\"\n  And he, who understood my covert speech,\nReplied: \"I was a novice in this state,\n  When I saw hither come a Mighty One,\n  With sign of victory incoronate.\nHence he drew forth the shade of the First Parent,\n  And that of his son Abel, and of Noah,\n  Of Moses the lawgiver, and the obedient\nAbraham, patriarch, and David, king,\n  Israel with his father and his children,\n  And Rachel, for whose sake he did so much,\nAnd others many, and he made them blessed;\n  And thou must know, that earlier than these\n  Never were any human spirits saved.\"\nWe ceased not to advance because he spake,\n  But still were passing onward through the forest,\n  The forest, say I, of thick-crowded ghosts.\nNot very far as yet our way had gone\n  This side the summit, when I saw a fire\n  That overcame a hemisphere of darkness.\nWe were a little distant from it still,\n  But not so far that I in part discerned not\n  That honourable people held that place.\n\"O thou who honourest every art and science,\n  Who may these be, which such great honour have,\n  That from the fashion of the rest it parts them?\"\nAnd he to me: \"The honourable name,\n  That sounds of them above there in thy life,\n  Wins grace in Heaven, that so advances them.\"\nIn the mean time a voice was heard by me:\n  \"All honour be to the pre-eminent Poet;\n  His shade returns again, that was departed.\"\nAfter the voice had ceased and quiet was,\n  Four mighty shades I saw approaching us;\n  Semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad.\nTo say to me began my gracious Master:\n  \"Him with that falchion in his hand behold,\n  Who comes before the three, even as their lord.\nThat one is Homer, Poet sovereign;\n  He who comes next is Horace, the satirist;\n  The third is Ovid, and the last is Lucan.\nBecause to each of these with me applies\n  The name that solitary voice proclaimed,\n  They do me honour, and in that do well.\"\nThus I beheld assemble the fair school\n  Of that lord of the song pre-eminent,\n  Who o'er the others like an eagle soars.\nWhen they together had discoursed somewhat,\n  They turned to me with signs of salutation,\n  And on beholding this, my Master smiled;\nAnd more of honour still, much more, they did me,\n  In that they made me one of their own band;\n  So that the sixth was I, 'mid so much wit.\nThus we went on as far as to the light,\n  Things saying 'tis becoming to keep silent,\n  As was the saying of them where I was.\nWe came unto a noble castle's foot,\n  Seven times encompassed with lofty walls,\n  Defended round by a fair rivulet;\nThis we passed over even as firm ground;\n  Through portals seven I entered with these Sages;\n  We came into a meadow of fresh verdure.\nPeople were there with solemn eyes and slow,\n  Of great authority in their countenance;\n  They spake but seldom, and with gentle voices.\nThus we withdrew ourselves upon one side\n  Into an opening luminous and lofty,\n  So that they all of them were visible.\nThere opposite, upon the green enamel,\n  Were pointed out to me the mighty spirits,\n  Whom to have seen I feel myself exalted.\nI saw Electra with companions many,\n  'Mongst whom I knew both Hector and Aeneas,\n  Caesar in armour with gerfalcon eyes;\nI saw Camilla and Penthesilea\n  On the other side, and saw the King Latinus,\n  Who with Lavinia his daughter sat;\nI saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin forth,\n  Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia,\n  And saw alone, apart, the Saladin.\nWhen I had lifted up my brows a little,\n  The Master I beheld of those who know,\n  Sit with his philosophic family.\nAll gaze upon him, and all do him honour.\n  There I beheld both Socrates and Plato,\n  Who nearer him before the others stand;\nDemocritus, who puts the world on chance,\n  Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales,\n  Zeno, Empedocles, and Heraclitus;\nOf qualities I saw the good collector,\n  Hight Dioscorides; and Orpheus saw I,\n  Tully and Livy, and moral Seneca,\nEuclid, geometrician, and Ptolemy,\n  Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna,\n  Averroes, who the great Comment made.\nI cannot all of them pourtray in full,\n  Because so drives me onward the long theme,\n  That many times the word comes short of fact.\nThe sixfold company in two divides;\n  Another way my sapient Guide conducts me\n  Forth from the quiet to the air that trembles;\nAnd to a place I come where nothing shines."

and then do thou implore them\n  By love which leadeth them, and they will come.\"\nSoon as the wind in our direction sways them,\n  My voice uplift I: \"O ye weary souls!\n  Come speak to us, if no one interdicts it.\"\nAs turtle-doves, called onward by desire,\n  With open and steady wings to the sweet nest\n  Fly through the air by their volition borne,\nSo came they from the band where Dido is,\n  Approaching us athwart the air malign,\n  So strong was the affectionate appeal.\n\"O living creature gracious and benignant,\n  Who visiting goest through the purple air\n  Us, who have stained the world incarnadine,\nIf were the King of the Universe our friend,\n  We would pray unto him to give thee peace,\n  Since thou hast pity on our woe perverse.\nOf what it pleases thee to hear and speak,\n  That will we hear, and we will speak to you,\n  While silent is the wind, as it is now.\nSitteth the city, wherein I was born,\n  Upon the sea-shore where the Po descends\n  To rest in peace with all his retinue.\nLove, that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize,\n  Seized this man for the person beautiful\n  That was ta'en from me, and still the mode offends me.\nLove, that exempts no one beloved from loving,\n  Seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly,\n  That, as thou seest, it doth not yet desert me;\nLove has conducted us unto one death;\n  Caina waiteth him who quenched our life!\"\n  These words were borne along from them to us.\nAs soon as I had heard those souls tormented,\n  I bowed my face, and so long held it down\n  Until the Poet said to me: \"What thinkest?\"\nWhen I made answer, I began: \"Alas!\n  How many pleasant thoughts, how much desire,\n  Conducted these unto the dolorous pass!\"\nThen unto them I turned me, and I spake,\n  And I began: \"Thine agonies, Francesca,\n  Sad and compassionate to weeping make me.\nBut tell me, at the time of those sweet sighs,\n  By what and in what manner Love conceded,\n  That you should know your dubious desires?\"\nAnd she to me: \"There is no greater sorrow\n  Than to be mindful of the happy time\n  In misery, and that thy Teacher knows.\nBut, if to recognise the earliest root\n  Of love in us thou hast so great desire,\n  I will do even as he who weeps and speaks.\nOne day we reading were for our delight\n  Of Launcelot, how Love did him enthral.\n  Alone we were and without any fear.\nFull many a time our eyes together drew\n  That reading, and drove the colour from our faces;\n  But one point only was it that o'ercame us.\nWhen as we read of the much-longed-for smile\n  Being by such a noble lover kissed,\n  This one, who ne'er from me shall be divided,\nKissed me upon the mouth all palpitating.\n  Galeotto was the book and he who wrote it.\n  That day no farther did we read therein.\"\nAnd all the while one spirit uttered this,\n  The other one did weep so, that, for pity,\n  I swooned away as if I had been dying,\nAnd fell, even as a dead body falls."

and the occasion\n  Tell me why so much discord has assailed it.\"\nAnd he to me: \"They, after long contention,\n  Will come to bloodshed; and the rustic party\n  Will drive the other out with much offence.\nThen afterwards behoves it this one fall\n  Within three suns, and rise again the other\n  By force of him who now is on the coast.\nHigh will it hold its forehead a long while,\n  Keeping the other under heavy burdens,\n  Howe'er it weeps thereat and is indignant.\nThe just are two, and are not understood there;\n  Envy and Arrogance and Avarice\n  Are the three sparks that have all hearts enkindled.\"\nHere ended he his tearful utterance;\n  And I to him: \"I wish thee still to teach me,\n  And make a gift to me of further speech.\nFarinata and Tegghiaio, once so worthy,\n  Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca,\n  And others who on good deeds set their thoughts,\nSay where they are, and cause that I may know them;\n  For great desire constraineth me to learn\n  If Heaven doth sweeten them, or Hell envenom.\"\nAnd he: \"They are among the blacker souls;\n  A different sin downweighs them to the bottom;\n  If thou so far descendest, thou canst see them.\nBut when thou art again in the sweet world,\n  I pray thee to the mind of others bring me;\n  No more I tell thee and no more I answer.\"\nThen his straightforward eyes he turned askance,\n  Eyed me a little, and then bowed his head;\n  He fell therewith prone like the other blind.\nAnd the Guide said to me: \"He wakes no more\n  This side the sound of the angelic trumpet;\n  When shall approach the hostile Potentate,\nEach one shall find again his dismal tomb,\n  Shall reassume his flesh and his own figure,\n  Shall hear what through eternity re-echoes.\"\nSo we passed onward o'er the filthy mixture\n  Of shadows and of rain with footsteps slow,\n  Touching a little on the future life.\nWherefore I said: \"Master, these torments here,\n  Will they increase after the mighty sentence,\n  Or lesser be, or will they be as burning?\"\nAnd he to me: \"Return unto thy science,\n  Which wills, that as the thing more perfect is,\n  The more it feels of pleasure and of pain.\nAlbeit that this people maledict\n  To true perfection never can attain,\n  Hereafter more than now they look to be.\"\nRound in a circle by that road we went,\n  Speaking much more, which I do not repeat;\n  We came unto the point where the descent is;\nThere we found Plutus the great enemy."

thee; for any power that he may have\n  Shall not prevent thy going down this crag.\"\nThen he turned round unto that bloated lip,\n  And said: \"Be silent, thou accursed wolf;\n  Consume within thyself with thine own rage.\nNot causeless is this journey to the abyss;\n  Thus is it willed on high, where Michael wrought\n  Vengeance upon the proud adultery.\"\nEven as the sails inflated by the wind\n  Involved together fall when snaps the mast,\n  So fell the cruel monster to the earth.\nThus we descended into the fourth chasm,\n  Gaining still farther on the dolesome shore\n  Which all the woe of the universe insacks.\nJustice of God, ah! who heaps up so many\n  New toils and sufferings as I beheld?\n  And why doth our transgression waste us so?\nAs doth the billow there upon Charybdis,\n  That breaks itself on that which it encounters,\n  So here the folk must dance their roundelay.\nHere saw I people, more than elsewhere, many,\n  On one side and the other, with great howls,\n  Rolling weights forward by main force of chest.\nThey clashed together, and then at that point\n  Each one turned backward, rolling retrograde,\n  Crying, \"Why keepest?\" and, \"Why squanderest thou?\"\nThus they returned along the lurid circle\n  On either hand unto the opposite point,\n  Shouting their shameful metre evermore.\nThen each, when he arrived there, wheeled about\n  Through his half-circle to another joust;\n  And I, who had my heart pierced as it were,\nExclaimed: \"My Master, now declare to me\n  What people these are, and if all were clerks,\n  These shaven crowns upon the left of us.\"\nAnd he to me: \"All of them were asquint\n  In intellect in the first life, so much\n  That there with measure they no spending made.\nClearly enough their voices bark it forth,\n  Whene'er they reach the two points of the circle,\n  Where sunders them the opposite defect.\nClerks those were who no hairy covering\n  Have on the head, and Popes and Cardinals,\n  In whom doth Avarice practise its excess.\"\nAnd I: \"My Master, among such as these\n  I ought forsooth to recognise some few,\n  Who were infected with these maladies.\"\nAnd he to me: \"Vain thought thou entertainest;\n  The undiscerning life which made them sordid\n  Now makes them unto all discernment dim.\nForever shall they come to these two buttings;\n  These from the sepulchre shall rise again\n  With the fist closed, and these with tresses shorn.\nIll giving and ill keeping the fair world\n  Have ta'en from them, and placed them in this scuffle;\n  Whate'er it be, no words adorn I for it.\nNow canst thou, Son, behold the transient farce\n  Of goods that are committed unto Fortune,\n  For which the human race each other buffet;\nFor all the gold that is beneath the moon,\n  Or ever has been, of these weary souls\n  Could never make a single one repose.\"\n\"Master,\" I said to him, \"now tell me also\n  What is this Fortune which thou speakest of,\n  That has the world's goods so within its clutches?\"\nAnd he to me: \"O creatures imbecile,\n  What ignorance is this which doth beset you?\n  Now will I have thee learn my judgment of her.\nHe whose omniscience everything transcends\n  The heavens created, and gave who should guide them,\n  That every part to every part may shine,\nDistributing the light in equal measure;\n  He in like manner to the mundane splendours\n  Ordained a general ministress and guide,\nThat she might change at times the empty treasures\n  From race to race, from one blood to another,\n  Beyond resistance of all human wisdom.\nTherefore one people triumphs, and another\n  Languishes, in pursuance of her judgment,\n  Which hidden is, as in the grass a serpent.\nYour knowledge has no counterstand against her;\n  She makes provision, judges, and pursues\n  Her governance, as theirs the other gods.\nHer permutations have not any truce;\n  Necessity makes her precipitate,\n  So often cometh who his turn obtains.\nAnd this is she who is so crucified\n  Even by those who ought to give her praise,\n  Giving her blame amiss, and bad repute.\nBut she is blissful, and she hears it not;\n  Among the other primal creatures gladsome\n  She turns her sphere, and blissful she rejoices.\nLet us descend now unto greater woe;\n  Already sinks each star that was ascending\n  When I set out, and loitering is forbidden.\"\nWe crossed the circle to the other bank,\n  Near to a fount that boils, and pours itself\n  Along a gully that runs out of it.\nThe water was more sombre far than perse;\n  And we, in company with the dusky waves,\n  Made entrance downward by a path uncouth.\nA marsh it makes, which has the name of Styx,\n  This tristful brooklet, when it has descended\n  Down to the foot of the malign gray shores.\nAnd I, who stood intent upon beholding,\n  Saw people mud-besprent in that lagoon,\n  All of them naked and with angry look.\nThey smote each other not alone with hands,\n  But with the head and with the breast and feet,\n  Tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth.\nSaid the good Master: \"Son, thou now beholdest\n  The souls of those whom anger overcame;\n  And likewise I would have thee know for certain\nBeneath the water people are who sigh\n  And make this water bubble at the surface,\n  As the eye tells thee wheresoe'er it turns.\nFixed in the mire they say, 'We sullen were\n  In the sweet air, which by the sun is gladdened,\n  Bearing within ourselves the sluggish reek;\nNow we are sullen in this sable mire.'\n  This hymn do they keep gurgling in their throats,\n  For with unbroken words they cannot say it.\"\nThus we went circling round the filthy fen\n  A great arc 'twixt the dry bank and the swamp,\n  With eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire;\nUnto the foot of a tower we came at last."

\"thou shalt not have us\n  Longer than in the passing of the slough.\"\nAs he who listens to some great deceit\n  That has been done to him, and then resents it,\n  Such became Phlegyas, in his gathered wrath.\nMy Guide descended down into the boat,\n  And then he made me enter after him,\n  And only when I entered seemed it laden.\nSoon as the Guide and I were in the boat,\n  The antique prow goes on its way, dividing\n  More of the water than 'tis wont with others.\nWhile we were running through the dead canal,\n  Uprose in front of me one full of mire,\n  And said, \"Who 'rt thou that comest ere the hour?\"\nAnd I to him: \"Although I come, I stay not;\n  But who art thou that hast become so squalid?\"\n  \"Thou seest that I am one who weeps,\" he answered.\nAnd I to him: \"With weeping and with wailing,\n  Thou spirit maledict, do thou remain;\n  For thee I know, though thou art all defiled.\"\nThen stretched he both his hands unto the boat;\n  Whereat my wary Master thrust him back,\n  Saying, \"Away there with the other dogs!\"\nThereafter with his arms he clasped my neck;\n  He kissed my face, and said: \"Disdainful soul,\n  Blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom.\nThat was an arrogant person in the world;\n  Goodness is none, that decks his memory;\n  So likewise here his shade is furious.\nHow many are esteemed great kings up there,\n  Who here shall be like unto swine in mire,\n  Leaving behind them horrible dispraises!\"\nAnd I: \"My Master, much should I be pleased,\n  If I could see him soused into this broth,\n  Before we issue forth out of the lake.\"\nAnd he to me: \"Ere unto thee the shore\n  Reveal itself, thou shalt be satisfied;\n  Such a desire 'tis meet thou shouldst enjoy.\"\nA little after that, I saw such havoc\n  Made of him by the people of the mire,\n  That still I praise and thank my God for it.\nThey all were shouting, \"At Philippo Argenti!\"\n  And that exasperate spirit Florentine\n  Turned round upon himself with his own teeth.\nWe left him there, and more of him I tell not;\n  But on mine ears there smote a lamentation,\n  Whence forward I intent unbar mine eyes.\nAnd the good Master said: \"Even now, my Son,\n  The city draweth near whose name is Dis,\n  With the grave citizens, with the great throng.\"\nAnd I: \"Its mosques already, Master, clearly\n  Within there in the valley I discern\n  Vermilion, as if issuing from the fire\nThey were.\"  And he to me: \"The fire eternal\n  That kindles them within makes them look red,\n  As thou beholdest in this nether Hell.\"\nThen we arrived within the moats profound,\n  That circumvallate that disconsolate city;\n  The walls appeared to me to be of iron.\nNot without making first a circuit wide,\n  We came unto a place where loud the pilot\n  Cried out to us, \"Debark, here is the entrance.\"\nMore than a thousand at the gates I saw\n  Out of the Heavens rained down, who angrily\n  Were saying, \"Who is this that without death\nGoes through the kingdom of the people dead?\"\n  And my sagacious Master made a sign\n  Of wishing secretly to speak with them.\nA little then they quelled their great disdain,\n  And said: \"Come thou alone, and he begone\n  Who has so boldly entered these dominions.\nLet him return alone by his mad road;\n  Try, if he can; for thou shalt here remain,\n  Who hast escorted him through such dark regions.\"\nThink, Reader, if I was discomforted\n  At utterance of the accursed words;\n  For never to return here I believed.\n\"O my dear Guide, who more than seven times\n  Hast rendered me security, and drawn me\n  From imminent peril that before me stood,\nDo not desert me,\" said I, \"thus undone;\n  And if the going farther be denied us,\n  Let us retrace our steps together swiftly.\"\nAnd that Lord, who had led me thitherward,\n  Said unto me: \"Fear not; because our passage\n  None can take from us, it by Such is given.\nBut here await me, and thy weary spirit\n  Comfort and nourish with a better hope;\n  For in this nether world I will not leave thee.\"\nSo onward goes and there abandons me\n  My Father sweet, and I remain in doubt,\n  For No and Yes within my head contend.\nI could not hear what he proposed to them;\n  But with them there he did not linger long,\n  Ere each within in rivalry ran back.\nThey closed the portals, those our adversaries,\n  On my Lord's breast, who had remained without\n  And turned to me with footsteps far between.\nHis eyes cast down, his forehead shorn had he\n  Of all its boldness, and he said, with sighs,\n  \"Who has denied to me the dolesome houses?\"\nAnd unto me: \"Thou, because I am angry,\n  Fear not, for I will conquer in the trial,\n  Whatever for defence within be planned.\nThis arrogance of theirs is nothing new;\n  For once they used it at less secret gate,\n  Which finds itself without a fastening still.\nO'er it didst thou behold the dead inscription;\n  And now this side of it descends the steep,\n  Passing across the circles without escort,\nOne by whose means the city shall be opened.\""

how disdainful he appeared to me!\n  He reached the gate, and with a little rod\n  He opened it, for there was no resistance.\n\"O banished out of Heaven, people despised!\"\n  Thus he began upon the horrid threshold;\n  \"Whence is this arrogance within you couched?\nWherefore recalcitrate against that will,\n  From which the end can never be cut off,\n  And which has many times increased your pain?\nWhat helpeth it to butt against the fates?\n  Your Cerberus, if you remember well,\n  For that still bears his chin and gullet peeled.\"\nThen he returned along the miry road,\n  And spake no word to us, but had the look\n  Of one whom other care constrains and goads\nThan that of him who in his presence is;\n  And we our feet directed tow'rds the city,\n  After those holy words all confident.\nWithin we entered without any contest;\n  And I, who inclination had to see\n  What the condition such a fortress holds,\nSoon as I was within, cast round mine eye,\n  And see on every hand an ample plain,\n  Full of distress and torment terrible.\nEven as at Arles, where stagnant grows the Rhone,\n  Even as at Pola near to the Quarnaro,\n  That shuts in Italy and bathes its borders,\nThe sepulchres make all the place uneven;\n  So likewise did they there on every side,\n  Saving that there the manner was more bitter;\nFor flames between the sepulchres were scattered,\n  By which they so intensely heated were,\n  That iron more so asks not any art.\nAll of their coverings uplifted were,\n  And from them issued forth such dire laments,\n  Sooth seemed they of the wretched and tormented.\nAnd I: \"My Master, what are all those people\n  Who, having sepulture within those tombs,\n  Make themselves audible by doleful sighs?\"\nAnd he to me: \"Here are the Heresiarchs,\n  With their disciples of all sects, and much\n  More than thou thinkest laden are the tombs.\nHere like together with its like is buried;\n  And more and less the monuments are heated.\"\n  And when he to the right had turned, we passed\nBetween the torments and high parapets."

Is he not still alive?\n  Does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?\"\nWhen he became aware of some delay,\n  Which I before my answer made, supine\n  He fell again, and forth appeared no more.\nBut the other, magnanimous, at whose desire\n  I had remained, did not his aspect change,\n  Neither his neck he moved, nor bent his side.\n\"And if,\" continuing his first discourse,\n  \"They have that art,\" he said, \"not learned aright,\n  That more tormenteth me, than doth this bed.\nBut fifty times shall not rekindled be\n  The countenance of the Lady who reigns here,\n  Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art;\nAnd as thou wouldst to the sweet world return,\n  Say why that people is so pitiless\n  Against my race in each one of its laws?\"\nWhence I to him: \"The slaughter and great carnage\n  Which have with crimson stained the Arbia, cause\n  Such orisons in our temple to be made.\"\nAfter his head he with a sigh had shaken,\n  \"There I was not alone,\" he said, \"nor surely\n  Without a cause had with the others moved.\nBut there I was alone, where every one\n  Consented to the laying waste of Florence,\n  He who defended her with open face.\"\n\"Ah! so hereafter may your seed repose,\"\n  I him entreated, \"solve for me that knot,\n  Which has entangled my conceptions here.\nIt seems that you can see, if I hear rightly,\n  Beforehand whatsoe'er time brings with it,\n  And in the present have another mode.\"\n\"We see, like those who have imperfect sight,\n  The things,\" he said, \"that distant are from us;\n  So much still shines on us the Sovereign Ruler.\nWhen they draw near, or are, is wholly vain\n  Our intellect, and if none brings it to us,\n  Not anything know we of your human state.\nHence thou canst understand, that wholly dead\n  Will be our knowledge from the moment when\n  The portal of the future shall be closed.\"\nThen I, as if compunctious for my fault,\n  Said: \"Now, then, you will tell that fallen one,\n  That still his son is with the living joined.\nAnd if just now, in answering, I was dumb,\n  Tell him I did it because I was thinking\n  Already of the error you have solved me.\"\nAnd now my Master was recalling me,\n  Wherefore more eagerly I prayed the spirit\n  That he would tell me who was with him there.\nHe said: \"With more than a thousand here I lie;\n  Within here is the second Frederick,\n  And the Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not.\"\nThereon he hid himself; and I towards\n  The ancient poet turned my steps, reflecting\n  Upon that saying, which seemed hostile to me.\nHe moved along; and afterward thus going,\n  He said to me, \"Why art thou so bewildered?\"\n  And I in his inquiry satisfied him.\n\"Let memory preserve what thou hast heard\n  Against thyself,\" that Sage commanded me,\n  \"And now attend here;\" and he raised his finger.\n\"When thou shalt be before the radiance sweet\n  Of her whose beauteous eyes all things behold,\n  From her thou'lt know the journey of thy life.\"\nUnto the left hand then he turned his feet;\n  We left the wall, and went towards the middle,\n  Along a path that strikes into a valley,\nWhich even up there unpleasant made its stench."

and he said: \"Thou art thinking\n  Perhaps upon this ruin, which is guarded\n  By that brute anger which just now I quenched.\nNow will I have thee know, the other time\n  I here descended to the nether Hell,\n  This precipice had not yet fallen down.\nBut truly, if I well discern, a little\n  Before His coming who the mighty spoil\n  Bore off from Dis, in the supernal circle,\nUpon all sides the deep and loathsome valley\n  Trembled so, that I thought the Universe\n  Was thrilled with love, by which there are who think\nThe world ofttimes converted into chaos;\n  And at that moment this primeval crag\n  Both here and elsewhere made such overthrow.\nBut fix thine eyes below;

if not, I draw the bow.\"\nMy Master said: \"Our answer will we make\n  To Chiron, near you there; in evil hour,\n  That will of thine was evermore so hasty.\"\nThen touched he me, and said: \"This one is Nessus,\n  Who perished for the lovely Dejanira,\n  And for himself, himself did vengeance take.\nAnd he in the midst, who at his breast is gazing,\n  Is the great Chiron, who brought up Achilles;\n  That other Pholus is, who was so wrathful.\nThousands and thousands go about the moat\n  Shooting with shafts whatever soul emerges\n  Out of the blood, more than his crime allots.\"\nNear we approached unto those monsters fleet;\n  Chiron an arrow took, and with the notch\n  Backward upon his jaws he put his beard.\nAfter he had uncovered his great mouth,\n  He said to his companions: \"Are you ware\n  That he behind moveth whate'er he touches?\nThus are not wont to do the feet of dead men.\"\n  And my good Guide, who now was at his breast,\n  Where the two natures are together joined,\nReplied: \"Indeed he lives, and thus alone\n  Me it behoves to show him the dark valley;\n  Necessity, and not delight, impels us.\nSome one withdrew from singing Halleluja,\n  Who unto me committed this new office;\n  No thief is he, nor I a thievish spirit.\nBut by that virtue through which I am moving\n  My steps along this savage thoroughfare,\n  Give us some one of thine, to be with us,\nAnd who may show us where to pass the ford,\n  And who may carry this one on his back;\n  For 'tis no spirit that can walk the air.\"\nUpon his right breast Chiron wheeled about,\n  And said to Nessus: \"Turn and do thou guide them,\n  And warn aside, if other band may meet you.\"\nWe with our faithful escort onward moved\n  Along the brink of the vermilion boiling,\n  Wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments.\nPeople I saw within up to the eyebrows,\n  And the great Centaur said: \"Tyrants are these,\n  Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging.\nHere they lament their pitiless mischiefs; here\n  Is Alexander, and fierce Dionysius\n  Who upon Sicily brought dolorous years.\nThat forehead there which has the hair so black\n  Is Azzolin; and the other who is blond,\n  Obizzo is of Esti, who, in truth,\nUp in the world was by his stepson slain.\"\n  Then turned I to the Poet; and he said,\n  \"Now he be first to thee, and second I.\"\nA little farther on the Centaur stopped\n  Above a folk, who far down as the throat\n  Seemed from that boiling stream to issue forth.\nA shade he showed us on one side alone,\n  Saying: \"He cleft asunder in God's bosom\n  The heart that still upon the Thames is honoured.\"\nThen people saw I, who from out the river\n  Lifted their heads and also all the chest;\n  And many among these I recognised.\nThus ever more and more grew shallower\n  That blood, so that the feet alone it covered;\n  And there across the moat our passage was.\n\"Even as thou here upon this side beholdest\n  The boiling stream, that aye diminishes,\"\n  The Centaur said, \"I wish thee to believe\nThat on this other more and more declines\n  Its bed, until it reunites itself\n  Where it behoveth tyranny to groan.\nJustice divine, upon this side, is goading\n  That Attila, who was a scourge on earth,\n  And Pyrrhus, and Sextus; and for ever milks\nThe tears which with the boiling it unseals\n  In Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo,\n  Who made upon the highways so much war.\"\nThen back he turned, and passed again the ford."

whence I prayed him\n  That he would give me largess of the food,\n  For which he had given me largess of desire.\n\"In the mid-sea there sits a wasted land,\"\n  Said he thereafterward, \"whose name is Crete,\n  Under whose king the world of old was chaste.\nThere is a mountain there, that once was glad\n  With waters and with leaves, which was called Ida;\n  Now 'tis deserted, as a thing worn out.\nRhea once chose it for the faithful cradle\n  Of her own son; and to conceal him better,\n  Whene'er he cried, she there had clamours made.\nA grand old man stands in the mount erect,\n  Who holds his shoulders turned tow'rds Damietta,\n  And looks at Rome as if it were his mirror.\nHis head is fashioned of refined gold,\n  And of pure silver are the arms and breast;\n  Then he is brass as far down as the fork.\nFrom that point downward all is chosen iron,\n  Save that the right foot is of kiln-baked clay,\n  And more he stands on that than on the other.\nEach part, except the gold, is by a fissure\n  Asunder cleft, that dripping is with tears,\n  Which gathered together perforate that cavern.\nFrom rock to rock they fall into this valley;\n  Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon they form;\n  Then downward go along this narrow sluice\nUnto that point where is no more descending.\n  They form Cocytus; what that pool may be\n  Thou shalt behold, so here 'tis not narrated.\"\nAnd I to him: \"If so the present runnel\n  Doth take its rise in this way from our world,\n  Why only on this verge appears it to us?\"\nAnd he to me: \"Thou knowest the place is round,\n  And notwithstanding thou hast journeyed far,\n  Still to the left descending to the bottom,\nThou hast not yet through all the circle turned.\n  Therefore if something new appear to us,\n  It should not bring amazement to thy face.\"\nAnd I again: \"Master, where shall be found\n  Lethe and Phlegethon, for of one thou'rt silent,\n  And sayest the other of this rain is made?\"\n\"In all thy questions truly thou dost please me,\"\n  Replied he; \"but the boiling of the red\n  Water might well solve one of them thou makest.\nThou shalt see Lethe, but outside this moat,\n  There where the souls repair to lave themselves,\n  When sin repented of has been removed.\"\nThen said he: \"It is time now to abandon\n  The wood; take heed that thou come after me;\n  A way the margins make that are not burning,\nAnd over them all vapours are extinguished.\""

I at thy skirts will come,\n  And afterward will I rejoin my band,\n  Which goes lamenting its eternal doom.\"\nI did not dare to go down from the road\n  Level to walk with him; but my head bowed\n  I held as one who goeth reverently.\nAnd he began: \"What fortune or what fate\n  Before the last day leadeth thee down here?\n  And who is this that showeth thee the way?\"\n\"Up there above us in the life serene,\"\n  I answered him, \"I lost me in a valley,\n  Or ever yet my age had been completed.\nBut yestermorn I turned my back upon it;\n  This one appeared to me, returning thither,\n  And homeward leadeth me along this road.\"\nAnd he to me: \"If thou thy star do follow,\n  Thou canst not fail thee of a glorious port,\n  If well I judged in the life beautiful.\nAnd if I had not died so prematurely,\n  Seeing Heaven thus benignant unto thee,\n  I would have given thee comfort in the work.\nBut that ungrateful and malignant people,\n  Which of old time from Fesole descended,\n  And smacks still of the mountain and the granite,\nWill make itself, for thy good deeds, thy foe;\n  And it is right; for among crabbed sorbs\n  It ill befits the sweet fig to bear fruit.\nOld rumour in the world proclaims them blind;\n  A people avaricious, envious, proud;\n  Take heed that of their customs thou do cleanse thee.\nThy fortune so much honour doth reserve thee,\n  One party and the other shall be hungry\n  For thee; but far from goat shall be the grass.\nTheir litter let the beasts of Fesole\n  Make of themselves, nor let them touch the plant,\n  If any still upon their dunghill rise,\nIn which may yet revive the consecrated\n  Seed of those Romans, who remained there when\n  The nest of such great malice it became.\"\n\"If my entreaty wholly were fulfilled,\"\n  Replied I to him, \"not yet would you be\n  In banishment from human nature placed;\nFor in my mind is fixed, and touches now\n  My heart the dear and good paternal image\n  Of you, when in the world from hour to hour\nYou taught me how a man becomes eternal;\n  And how much I am grateful, while I live\n  Behoves that in my language be discerned.\nWhat you narrate of my career I write,\n  And keep it to be glossed with other text\n  By a Lady who can do it, if I reach her.\nThis much will I have manifest to you;\n  Provided that my conscience do not chide me,\n  For whatsoever Fortune I am ready.\nSuch handsel is not new unto mine ears;\n  Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel around\n  As it may please her, and the churl his mattock.\"\nMy Master thereupon on his right cheek\n  Did backward turn himself, and looked at me;\n  Then said: \"He listeneth well who noteth it.\"\nNor speaking less on that account, I go\n  With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are\n  His most known and most eminent companions.\nAnd he to me: \"To know of some is well;\n  Of others it were laudable to be silent,\n  For short would be the time for so much speech.\nKnow them in sum, that all of them were clerks,\n  And men of letters great and of great fame,\n  In the world tainted with the selfsame sin.\nPriscian goes yonder with that wretched crowd,\n  And Francis of Accorso; and thou hadst seen there\n  If thou hadst had a hankering for such scurf,\nThat one, who by the Servant of the Servants\n  From Arno was transferred to Bacchiglione,\n  Where he has left his sin-excited nerves.\nMore would I say, but coming and discoursing\n  Can be no longer;

and seemed to be among them\nThe one who wins, and not the one who loses."

what wounds I saw upon their limbs,\n  Recent and ancient by the flames burnt in!\n  It pains me still but to remember it.\nUnto their cries my Teacher paused attentive;\n  He turned his face towards me, and \"Now wait,\"\n  He said; \"to these we should be courteous.\nAnd if it were not for the fire that darts\n  The nature of this region, I should say\n  That haste were more becoming thee than them.\"\nAs soon as we stood still, they recommenced\n  The old refrain, and when they overtook us,\n  Formed of themselves a wheel, all three of them.\nAs champions stripped and oiled are wont to do,\n  Watching for their advantage and their hold,\n  Before they come to blows and thrusts between them,\nThus, wheeling round, did every one his visage\n  Direct to me, so that in opposite wise\n  His neck and feet continual journey made.\nAnd, \"If the misery of this soft place\n  Bring in disdain ourselves and our entreaties,\"\n  Began one, \"and our aspect black and blistered,\nLet the renown of us thy mind incline\n  To tell us who thou art, who thus securely\n  Thy living feet dost move along through Hell.\nHe in whose footprints thou dost see me treading,\n  Naked and skinless though he now may go,\n  Was of a greater rank than thou dost think;\nHe was the grandson of the good Gualdrada;\n  His name was Guidoguerra, and in life\n  Much did he with his wisdom and his sword.\nThe other, who close by me treads the sand,\n  Tegghiaio Aldobrandi is, whose fame\n  Above there in the world should welcome be.\nAnd I, who with them on the cross am placed,\n  Jacopo Rusticucci was; and truly\n  My savage wife, more than aught else, doth harm me.\"\nCould I have been protected from the fire,\n  Below I should have thrown myself among them,\n  And think the Teacher would have suffered it;\nBut as I should have burned and baked myself,\n  My terror overmastered my good will,\n  Which made me greedy of embracing them.\nThen I began: \"Sorrow and not disdain\n  Did your condition fix within me so,\n  That tardily it wholly is stripped off,\nAs soon as this my Lord said unto me\n  Words, on account of which I thought within me\n  That people such as you are were approaching.\nI of your city am; and evermore\n  Your labours and your honourable names\n  I with affection have retraced and heard.\nI leave the gall, and go for the sweet fruits\n  Promised to me by the veracious Leader;\n  But to the centre first I needs must plunge.\"\n\"So may the soul for a long while conduct\n  Those limbs of thine,\" did he make answer then,\n  \"And so may thy renown shine after thee,\nValour and courtesy, say if they dwell\n  Within our city, as they used to do,\n  Or if they wholly have gone out of it;\nFor Guglielmo Borsier, who is in torment\n  With us of late, and goes there with his comrades,\n  Doth greatly mortify us with his words.\"\n\"The new inhabitants and the sudden gains,\n  Pride and extravagance have in thee engendered,\n  Florence, so that thou weep'st thereat already!\"\nIn this wise I exclaimed with face uplifted;\n  And the three, taking that for my reply,\n  Looked at each other, as one looks at truth.\n\"If other times so little it doth cost thee,\"\n  Replied they all, \"to satisfy another,\n  Happy art thou, thus speaking at thy will!\nTherefore, if thou escape from these dark places,\n  And come to rebehold the beauteous stars,\n  When it shall pleasure thee to say, 'I was,'\nSee that thou speak of us unto the people.\"\n  Then they broke up the wheel, and in their flight\n  It seemed as if their agile legs were wings.\nNot an Amen could possibly be said\n  So rapidly as they had disappeared;\n  Wherefore the Master deemed best to depart.\nI followed him, and little had we gone,\n  Before the sound of water was so near us,\n  That speaking we should hardly have been heard.\nEven as that stream which holdeth its own course\n  The first from Monte Veso tow'rds the East,\n  Upon the left-hand slope of Apennine,\nWhich is above called Acquacheta, ere\n  It down descendeth into its low bed,\n  And at Forli is vacant of that name,\nReverberates there above San Benedetto\n  From Alps, by falling at a single leap,\n  Where for a thousand there were room enough;\nThus downward from a bank precipitate,\n  We found resounding that dark-tinted water,\n  So that it soon the ear would have offended.\nI had a cord around about me girt,\n  And therewithal I whilom had designed\n  To take the panther with the painted skin.\nAfter I this had all from me unloosed,\n  As my Conductor had commanded me,\n  I reached it to him, gathered up and coiled,\nWhereat he turned himself to the right side,\n  And at a little distance from the verge,\n  He cast it down into that deep abyss.\n\"It must needs be some novelty respond,\"\n  I said within myself, \"to the new signal\n  The Master with his eye is following so.\"\nAh me! how very cautious men should be\n  With those who not alone behold the act,\n  But with their wisdom look into the thoughts!\nHe said to me: \"Soon there will upward come\n  What I await; and what thy thought is dreaming\n  Must soon reveal itself unto thy sight.\"\nAye to that truth which has the face of falsehood,\n  A man should close his lips as far as may be,\n  Because without his fault it causes shame;\nBut here I cannot; and, Reader, by the notes\n  Of this my Comedy to thee I swear,\n  So may they not be void of lasting favour,\nAthwart that dense and darksome atmosphere\n  I saw a figure swimming upward come,\n  Marvellous unto every steadfast heart,\nEven as he returns who goeth down\n  Sometimes to clear an anchor, which has grappled\n  Reef, or aught else that in the sea is hidden,\nWho upward stretches, and draws in his feet."

but I perceived\nThat from the neck of each there hung a pouch,\n  Which certain colour had, and certain blazon;\n  And thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding.\nAnd as I gazing round me come among them,\n  Upon a yellow pouch I azure saw\n  That had the face and posture of a lion.\nProceeding then the current of my sight,\n  Another of them saw I, red as blood,\n  Display a goose more white than butter is.\nAnd one, who with an azure sow and gravid\n  Emblazoned had his little pouch of white,\n  Said unto me: \"What dost thou in this moat?\nNow get thee gone; and since thou'rt still alive,\n  Know that a neighbour of mine, Vitaliano,\n  Will have his seat here on my left-hand side.\nA Paduan am I with these Florentines;\n  Full many a time they thunder in mine ears,\n  Exclaiming, 'Come the sovereign cavalier,\nHe who shall bring the satchel with three goats;'\"\n  Then twisted he his mouth, and forth he thrust\n  His tongue, like to an ox that licks its nose.\nAnd fearing lest my longer stay might vex\n  Him who had warned me not to tarry long,\n  Backward I turned me from those weary souls.\nI found my Guide, who had already mounted\n  Upon the back of that wild animal,\n  And said to me: \"Now be both strong and bold.\nNow we descend by stairways such as these;\n  Mount thou in front, for I will be midway,\n  So that the tail may have no power to harm thee.\"\nSuch as he is who has so near the ague\n  Of quartan that his nails are blue already,\n  And trembles all, but looking at the shade;\nEven such became I at those proffered words;\n  But shame in me his menaces produced,\n  Which maketh servant strong before good master.\nI seated me upon those monstrous shoulders;\n  I wished to say, and yet the voice came not\n  As I believed, \"Take heed that thou embrace me.\"\nBut he, who other times had rescued me\n  In other peril, soon as I had mounted,\n  Within his arms encircled and sustained me,\nAnd said: \"Now, Geryon, bestir thyself;\n  The circles large, and the descent be little;\n  Think of the novel burden which thou hast.\"\nEven as the little vessel shoves from shore,\n  Backward, still backward, so he thence withdrew;\n  And when he wholly felt himself afloat,\nThere where his breast had been he turned his tail,\n  And that extended like an eel he moved,\n  And with his paws drew to himself the air.\nA greater fear I do not think there was\n  What time abandoned Phaeton the reins,\n  Whereby the heavens, as still appears, were scorched;\nNor when the wretched Icarus his flanks\n  Felt stripped of feathers by the melting wax,\n  His father crying, \"An ill way thou takest!\"\nThan was my own, when I perceived myself\n  On all sides in the air, and saw extinguished\n  The sight of everything but of the monster.\nOnward he goeth, swimming slowly, slowly;\n  Wheels and descends, but I perceive it only\n  By wind upon my face and from below.\nI heard already on the right the whirlpool\n  Making a horrible crashing under us;\n  Whence I thrust out my head with eyes cast downward.\nThen was I still more fearful of the abyss;\n  Because I fires beheld, and heard laments,\n  Whereat I, trembling, all the closer cling.\nI saw then, for before I had not seen it,\n  The turning and descending, by great horrors\n  That were approaching upon divers sides.\nAs falcon who has long been on the wing,\n  Who, without seeing either lure or bird,\n  Maketh the falconer say, \"Ah me, thou stoopest,\"\nDescendeth weary, whence he started swiftly,\n  Thorough a hundred circles, and alights\n  Far from his master, sullen and disdainful;\nEven thus did Geryon place us on the bottom,\n  Close to the bases of the rough-hewn rock,\n  And being disencumbered of our persons,\nHe sped away as arrow from the string."

how they did make them lift their legs\n  At the first blows! and sooth not any one\n  The second waited for, nor for the third.\nWhile I was going on, mine eyes by one\n  Encountered were; and straight I said: \"Already\n  With sight of this one I am not unfed.\"\nTherefore I stayed my feet to make him out,\n  And with me the sweet Guide came to a stand,\n  And to my going somewhat back assented;\nAnd he, the scourged one, thought to hide himself,\n  Lowering his face, but little it availed him;\n  For said I: \"Thou that castest down thine eyes,\nIf false are not the features which thou bearest,\n  Thou art Venedico Caccianimico;\n  But what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces?\"\nAnd he to me: \"Unwillingly I tell it;\n  But forces me thine utterance distinct,\n  Which makes me recollect the ancient world.\nI was the one who the fair Ghisola\n  Induced to grant the wishes of the Marquis,\n  Howe'er the shameless story may be told.\nNot the sole Bolognese am I who weeps here;\n  Nay, rather is this place so full of them,\n  That not so many tongues to-day are taught\n'Twixt Reno and Savena to say 'sipa;'\n  And if thereof thou wishest pledge or proof,\n  Bring to thy mind our avaricious heart.\"\nWhile speaking in this manner, with his scourge\n  A demon smote him, and said: \"Get thee gone\n  Pander, there are no women here for coin.\"\nI joined myself again unto mine Escort;\n  Thereafterward with footsteps few we came\n  To where a crag projected from the bank.\nThis very easily did we ascend,\n  And turning to the right along its ridge,\n  From those eternal circles we departed.\nWhen we were there, where it is hollowed out\n  Beneath, to give a passage to the scourged,\n  The Guide said: \"Wait, and see that on thee strike\nThe vision of those others evil-born,\n  Of whom thou hast not yet beheld the faces,\n  Because together with us they have gone.\"\nFrom the old bridge we looked upon the train\n  Which tow'rds us came upon the other border,\n  And which the scourges in like manner smite.\nAnd the good Master, without my inquiring,\n  Said to me: \"See that tall one who is coming,\n  And for his pain seems not to shed a tear;\nStill what a royal aspect he retains!\n  That Jason is, who by his heart and cunning\n  The Colchians of the Ram made destitute.\nHe by the isle of Lemnos passed along\n  After the daring women pitiless\n  Had unto death devoted all their males.\nThere with his tokens and with ornate words\n  Did he deceive Hypsipyle, the maiden\n  Who first, herself, had all the rest deceived.\nThere did he leave her pregnant and forlorn;\n  Such sin unto such punishment condemns him,\n  And also for Medea is vengeance done.\nWith him go those who in such wise deceive;\n  And this sufficient be of the first valley\n  To know, and those that in its jaws it holds.\"\nWe were already where the narrow path\n  Crosses athwart the second dike, and forms\n  Of that a buttress for another arch.\nThence we heard people, who are making moan\n  In the next Bolgia, snorting with their muzzles,\n  And with their palms beating upon themselves\nThe margins were incrusted with a mould\n  By exhalation from below, that sticks there,\n  And with the eyes and nostrils wages war.\nThe bottom is so deep, no place suffices\n  To give us sight of it, without ascending\n  The arch's back, where most the crag impends.\nThither we came, and thence down in the moat\n  I saw a people smothered in a filth\n  That out of human privies seemed to flow;\nAnd whilst below there with mine eye I search,\n  I saw one with his head so foul with ordure,\n  It was not clear if he were clerk or layman.\nHe screamed to me: \"Wherefore art thou so eager\n  To look at me more than the other foul ones?\"\n  And I to him: \"Because, if I remember,\nI have already seen thee with dry hair,\n  And thou'rt Alessio Interminei of Lucca;\n  Therefore I eye thee more than all the others.\"\nAnd he thereon, belabouring his pumpkin:\n  \"The flatteries have submerged me here below,\n  Wherewith my tongue was never surfeited.\"\nThen said to me the Guide: \"See that thou thrust\n  Thy visage somewhat farther in advance,\n  That with thine eyes thou well the face attain\nOf that uncleanly and dishevelled drab,\n  Who there doth scratch herself with filthy nails,\n  And crouches now, and now on foot is standing.\nThais the harlot is it, who replied\n  Unto her paramour, when he said, 'Have I\n  Great gratitude from thee?'--'Nay, marvellous;'\nAnd herewith let our sight be satisfied.\""

and as his king was pliant,\n  So he who governs France shall be to this one.\"\nI do not know if I were here too bold,\n  That him I answered only in this metre:\n  \"I pray thee tell me now how great a treasure\nOur Lord demanded of Saint Peter first,\n  Before he put the keys into his keeping?\n  Truly he nothing asked but 'Follow me.'\nNor Peter nor the rest asked of Matthias\n  Silver or gold, when he by lot was chosen\n  Unto the place the guilty soul had lost.\nTherefore stay here, for thou art justly punished,\n  And keep safe guard o'er the ill-gotten money,\n  Which caused thee to be valiant against Charles.\nAnd were it not that still forbids it me\n  The reverence for the keys superlative\n  Thou hadst in keeping in the gladsome life,\nI would make use of words more grievous still;\n  Because your avarice afflicts the world,\n  Trampling the good and lifting the depraved.\nThe Evangelist you Pastors had in mind,\n  When she who sitteth upon many waters\n  To fornicate with kings by him was seen;\nThe same who with the seven heads was born,\n  And power and strength from the ten horns received,\n  So long as virtue to her spouse was pleasing.\nYe have made yourselves a god of gold and silver;\n  And from the idolater how differ ye,\n  Save that he one, and ye a hundred worship?\nAh, Constantine! of how much ill was mother,\n  Not thy conversion, but that marriage dower\n  Which the first wealthy Father took from thee!\"\nAnd while I sang to him such notes as these,\n  Either that anger or that conscience stung him,\n  He struggled violently with both his feet.\nI think in sooth that it my Leader pleased,\n  With such contented lip he listened ever\n  Unto the sound of the true words expressed.\nTherefore with both his arms he took me up,\n  And when he had me all upon his breast,\n  Remounted by the way where he descended.\nNor did he tire to have me clasped to him;\n  But bore me to the summit of the arch\n  Which from the fourth dike to the fifth is passage.\nThere tenderly he laid his burden down,\n  Tenderly on the crag uneven and steep,\n  That would have been hard passage for the goats:\nThence was unveiled to me another valley."

Why dost leave the war?'\n  And downward ceased he not to fall amain\n  As far as Minos, who lays hold on all.\nSee, he has made a bosom of his shoulders!\n  Because he wished to see too far before him\n  Behind he looks, and backward goes his way:\nBehold Tiresias, who his semblance changed,\n  When from a male a female he became,\n  His members being all of them transformed;\nAnd afterwards was forced to strike once more\n  The two entangled serpents with his rod,\n  Ere he could have again his manly plumes.\nThat Aruns is, who backs the other's belly,\n  Who in the hills of Luni, there where grubs\n  The Carrarese who houses underneath,\nAmong the marbles white a cavern had\n  For his abode; whence to behold the stars\n  And sea, the view was not cut off from him.\nAnd she there, who is covering up her breasts,\n  Which thou beholdest not, with loosened tresses,\n  And on that side has all the hairy skin,\nWas Manto, who made quest through many lands,\n  Afterwards tarried there where I was born;\n  Whereof I would thou list to me a little.\nAfter her father had from life departed,\n  And the city of Bacchus had become enslaved,\n  She a long season wandered through the world.\nAbove in beauteous Italy lies a lake\n  At the Alp's foot that shuts in Germany\n  Over Tyrol, and has the name Benaco.\nBy a thousand springs, I think, and more, is bathed,\n  'Twixt Garda and Val Camonica, Pennino,\n  With water that grows stagnant in that lake.\nMidway a place is where the Trentine Pastor,\n  And he of Brescia, and the Veronese\n  Might give his blessing, if he passed that way.\nSitteth Peschiera, fortress fair and strong,\n  To front the Brescians and the Bergamasks,\n  Where round about the bank descendeth lowest.\nThere of necessity must fall whatever\n  In bosom of Benaco cannot stay,\n  And grows a river down through verdant pastures.\nSoon as the water doth begin to run,\n  No more Benaco is it called, but Mincio,\n  Far as Governo, where it falls in Po.\nNot far it runs before it finds a plain\n  In which it spreads itself, and makes it marshy,\n  And oft 'tis wont in summer to be sickly.\nPassing that way the virgin pitiless\n  Land in the middle of the fen descried,\n  Untilled and naked of inhabitants;\nThere to escape all human intercourse,\n  She with her servants stayed, her arts to practise\n  And lived, and left her empty body there.\nThe men, thereafter, who were scattered round,\n  Collected in that place, which was made strong\n  By the lagoon it had on every side;\nThey built their city over those dead bones,\n  And, after her who first the place selected,\n  Mantua named it, without other omen.\nIts people once within more crowded were,\n  Ere the stupidity of Casalodi\n  From Pinamonte had received deceit.\nTherefore I caution thee, if e'er thou hearest\n  Originate my city otherwise,\n  No falsehood may the verity defraud.\"\nAnd I: \"My Master, thy discourses are\n  To me so certain, and so take my faith,\n  That unto me the rest would be spent coals.\nBut tell me of the people who are passing,\n  If any one note-worthy thou beholdest,\n  For only unto that my mind reverts.\"\nThen said he to me: \"He who from the cheek\n  Thrusts out his beard upon his swarthy shoulders\n  Was, at the time when Greece was void of males,\nSo that there scarce remained one in the cradle,\n  An augur, and with Calchas gave the moment,\n  In Aulis, when to sever the first cable.\nEryphylus his name was, and so sings\n  My lofty Tragedy in some part or other;\n  That knowest thou well, who knowest the whole of it.\nThe next, who is so slender in the flanks,\n  Was Michael Scott, who of a verity\n  Of magical illusions knew the game.\nBehold Guido Bonatti, behold Asdente,\n  Who now unto his leather and his thread\n  Would fain have stuck, but he too late repents.\nBehold the wretched ones, who left the needle,\n  The spool and rock, and made them fortune-tellers;\n  They wrought their magic spells with herb and image.\nBut come now, for already holds the confines\n  Of both the hemispheres, and under Seville\n  Touches the ocean-wave, Cain and the thorns,\nAnd yesternight the moon was round already;\n  Thou shouldst remember well it did not harm thee\n  From time to time within the forest deep.\"\nThus spake he to me, and we walked the while."

and instead thereof\n  One makes his vessel new, and one recaulks\n  The ribs of that which many a voyage has made;\nOne hammers at the prow, one at the stern,\n  This one makes oars, and that one cordage twists,\n  Another mends the mainsail and the mizzen;\nThus, not by fire, but by the art divine,\n  Was boiling down below there a dense pitch\n  Which upon every side the bank belimed.\nI saw it, but I did not see within it\n  Aught but the bubbles that the boiling raised,\n  And all swell up and resubside compressed.\nThe while below there fixedly I gazed,\n  My Leader, crying out: \"Beware, beware!\"\n  Drew me unto himself from where I stood.\nThen I turned round, as one who is impatient\n  To see what it behoves him to escape,\n  And whom a sudden terror doth unman,\nWho, while he looks, delays not his departure;\n  And I beheld behind us a black devil,\n  Running along upon the crag, approach.\nAh, how ferocious was he in his aspect!\n  And how he seemed to me in action ruthless,\n  With open wings and light upon his feet!\nHis shoulders, which sharp-pointed were and high,\n  A sinner did encumber with both haunches,\n  And he held clutched the sinews of the feet.\nFrom off our bridge, he said: \"O Malebranche,\n  Behold one of the elders of Saint Zita;\n  Plunge him beneath, for I return for others\nUnto that town, which is well furnished with them.\n  All there are barrators, except Bonturo;\n  No into Yes for money there is changed.\"\nHe hurled him down, and over the hard crag\n  Turned round, and never was a mastiff loosened\n  In so much hurry to pursue a thief.\nThe other sank, and rose again face downward;\n  But the demons, under cover of the bridge,\n  Cried: \"Here the Santo Volto has no place!\nHere swims one otherwise than in the Serchio;\n  Therefore, if for our gaffs thou wishest not,\n  Do not uplift thyself above the pitch.\"\nThey seized him then with more than a hundred rakes;\n  They said: \"It here behoves thee to dance covered,\n  That, if thou canst, thou secretly mayest pilfer.\"\nNot otherwise the cooks their scullions make\n  Immerse into the middle of the caldron\n  The meat with hooks, so that it may not float.\nSaid the good Master to me: \"That it be not\n  Apparent thou art here, crouch thyself down\n  Behind a jag, that thou mayest have some screen;\nAnd for no outrage that is done to me\n  Be thou afraid, because these things I know,\n  For once before was I in such a scuffle.\"\nThen he passed on beyond the bridge's head,\n  And as upon the sixth bank he arrived,\n  Need was for him to have a steadfast front.\nWith the same fury, and the same uproar,\n  As dogs leap out upon a mendicant,\n  Who on a sudden begs, where'er he stops,\nThey issued from beneath the little bridge,\n  And turned against him all their grappling-irons;\n  But he cried out: \"Be none of you malignant!\nBefore those hooks of yours lay hold of me,\n  Let one of you step forward, who may hear me,\n  And then take counsel as to grappling me.\"\nThey all cried out: \"Let Malacoda go;\"\n  Whereat one started, and the rest stood still,\n  And he came to him, saying: \"What avails it?\"\n\"Thinkest thou, Malacoda, to behold me\n  Advanced into this place,\" my Master said,\n  \"Safe hitherto from all your skill of fence,\nWithout the will divine, and fate auspicious?\n  Let me go on, for it in Heaven is willed\n  That I another show this savage road.\"\nThen was his arrogance so humbled in him,\n  That he let fall his grapnel at his feet,\n  And to the others said: \"Now strike him not.\"\nAnd unto me my Guide: \"O thou, who sittest\n  Among the splinters of the bridge crouched down,\n  Securely now return to me again.\"\nWherefore I started and came swiftly to him;\n  And all the devils forward thrust themselves,\n  So that I feared they would not keep their compact.\nAnd thus beheld I once afraid the soldiers\n  Who issued under safeguard from Caprona,\n  Seeing themselves among so many foes.\nClose did I press myself with all my person\n  Beside my Leader, and turned not mine eyes\n  From off their countenance, which was not good.\nThey lowered their rakes, and \"Wilt thou have me hit him,\"\n  They said to one another, \"on the rump?\"\n  And answered: \"Yes; see that thou nick him with it.\"\nBut the same demon who was holding parley\n  With my Conductor turned him very quickly,\n  And said: \"Be quiet, be quiet, Scarmiglione;\"\nThen said to us: \"You can no farther go\n  Forward upon this crag, because is lying\n  All shattered, at the bottom, the sixth arch.\nAnd if it still doth please you to go onward,\n  Pursue your way along upon this rock;\n  Near is another crag that yields a path.\nYesterday, five hours later than this hour,\n  One thousand and two hundred sixty-six\n  Years were complete, that here the way was broken.\nI send in that direction some of mine\n  To see if any one doth air himself;\n  Go ye with them; for they will not be vicious.\nStep forward, Alichino and Calcabrina,\"\n  Began he to cry out, \"and thou, Cagnazzo;\n  And Barbariccia, do thou guide the ten.\nCome forward, Libicocco and Draghignazzo,\n  And tusked Ciriatto and Graffiacane,\n  And Farfarello and mad Rubicante;\nSearch ye all round about the boiling pitch;\n  Let these be safe as far as the next crag,\n  That all unbroken passes o'er the dens.\"\n\"O me! what is it, Master, that I see?\n  Pray let us go,\" I said, \"without an escort,\n  If thou knowest how, since for myself I ask none.\nIf thou art as observant as thy wont is,\n  Dost thou not see that they do gnash their teeth,\n  And with their brows are threatening woe to us?\"\nAnd he to me: \"I will not have thee fear;\n  Let them gnash on, according to their fancy,\n  Because they do it for those boiling wretches.\"\nAlong the left-hand dike they wheeled about;\n  But first had each one thrust his tongue between\n  His teeth towards their leader for a signal;\nAnd he had made a trumpet of his rump."

we have them now behind us;\n  I so imagine them, I already feel them.\"\nAnd he: \"If I were made of leaded glass,\n  Thine outward image I should not attract\n  Sooner to me than I imprint the inner.\nJust now thy thoughts came in among my own,\n  With similar attitude and similar face,\n  So that of both one counsel sole I made.\nIf peradventure the right bank so slope\n  That we to the next Bolgia can descend,\n  We shall escape from the imagined chase.\"\nNot yet he finished rendering such opinion,\n  When I beheld them come with outstretched wings,\n  Not far remote, with will to seize upon us.\nMy Leader on a sudden seized me up,\n  Even as a mother who by noise is wakened,\n  And close beside her sees the enkindled flames,\nWho takes her son, and flies, and does not stop,\n  Having more care of him than of herself,\n  So that she clothes her only with a shift;\nAnd downward from the top of the hard bank\n  Supine he gave him to the pendent rock,\n  That one side of the other Bolgia walls.\nNe'er ran so swiftly water through a sluice\n  To turn the wheel of any land-built mill,\n  When nearest to the paddles it approaches,\nAs did my Master down along that border,\n  Bearing me with him on his breast away,\n  As his own son, and not as a companion.\nHardly the bed of the ravine below\n  His feet had reached, ere they had reached the hill\n  Right over us; but he was not afraid;\nFor the high Providence, which had ordained\n  To place them ministers of the fifth moat,\n  The power of thence departing took from all.\nA painted people there below we found,\n  Who went about with footsteps very slow,\n  Weeping and in their semblance tired and vanquished.\nThey had on mantles with the hoods low down\n  Before their eyes, and fashioned of the cut\n  That in Cologne they for the monks are made.\nWithout, they gilded are so that it dazzles;\n  But inwardly all leaden and so heavy\n  That Frederick used to put them on of straw.\nO everlastingly fatiguing mantle!\n  Again we turned us, still to the left hand\n  Along with them, intent on their sad plaint;\nBut owing to the weight, that weary folk\n  Came on so tardily, that we were new\n  In company at each motion of the haunch.\nWhence I unto my Leader: \"See thou find\n  Some one who may by deed or name be known,\n  And thus in going move thine eye about.\"\nAnd one, who understood the Tuscan speech,\n  Cried to us from behind: \"Stay ye your feet,\n  Ye, who so run athwart the dusky air!\nPerhaps thou'lt have from me what thou demandest.\"\n  Whereat the Leader turned him, and said: \"Wait,\n  And then according to his pace proceed.\"\nI stopped, and two beheld I show great haste\n  Of spirit, in their faces, to be with me;\n  But the burden and the narrow way delayed them.\nWhen they came up, long with an eye askance\n  They scanned me without uttering a word.\n  Then to each other turned, and said together:\n\"He by the action of his throat seems living;\n  And if they dead are, by what privilege\n  Go they uncovered by the heavy stole?\"\nThen said to me: \"Tuscan, who to the college\n  Of miserable hypocrites art come,\n  Do not disdain to tell us who thou art.\"\nAnd I to them: \"Born was I, and grew up\n  In the great town on the fair river of Arno,\n  And with the body am I've always had.\nBut who are ye, in whom there trickles down\n  Along your cheeks such grief as I behold?\n  And what pain is upon you, that so sparkles?\"\nAnd one replied to me: \"These orange cloaks\n  Are made of lead so heavy, that the weights\n  Cause in this way their balances to creak.\nFrati Gaudenti were we, and Bolognese;\n  I Catalano, and he Loderingo\n  Named, and together taken by thy city,\nAs the wont is to take one man alone,\n  For maintenance of its peace; and we were such\n  That still it is apparent round Gardingo.\"\n\"O Friars,\" began I, \"your iniquitous. . .\"\n  But said no more; for to mine eyes there rushed\n  One crucified with three stakes on the ground.\nWhen me he saw, he writhed himself all over,\n  Blowing into his beard with suspirations;\n  And the Friar Catalan, who noticed this,\nSaid to me: \"This transfixed one, whom thou seest,\n  Counselled the Pharisees that it was meet\n  To put one man to torture for the people.\nCrosswise and naked is he on the path,\n  As thou perceivest; and he needs must feel,\n  Whoever passes, first how much he weighs;\nAnd in like mode his father-in-law is punished\n  Within this moat, and the others of the council,\n  Which for the Jews was a malignant seed.\"\nAnd thereupon I saw Virgilius marvel\n  O'er him who was extended on the cross\n  So vilely in eternal banishment.\nThen he directed to the Friar this voice:\n  \"Be not displeased, if granted thee, to tell us\n  If to the right hand any pass slope down\nBy which we two may issue forth from here,\n  Without constraining some of the black angels\n  To come and extricate us from this deep.\"\nThen he made answer: \"Nearer than thou hopest\n  There is a rock, that forth from the great circle\n  Proceeds, and crosses all the cruel valleys,\nSave that at this 'tis broken, and does not bridge it;\n  You will be able to mount up the ruin,\n  That sidelong slopes and at the bottom rises.\"\nThe Leader stood awhile with head bowed down;\n  Then said: \"The business badly he recounted\n  Who grapples with his hook the sinners yonder.\"\nAnd the Friar: \"Many of the Devil's vices\n  Once heard I at Bologna, and among them,\n  That he's a liar and the father of lies.\"\nThereat my Leader with great strides went on,\n  Somewhat disturbed with anger in his looks;\n  Whence from the heavy-laden I departed\nAfter the prints of his beloved feet."

at one who was upon our side\n  There darted forth a serpent, which transfixed him\n  There where the neck is knotted to the shoulders.\nNor 'O' so quickly e'er, nor 'I' was written,\n  As he took fire, and burned; and ashes wholly\n  Behoved it that in falling he became.\nAnd when he on the ground was thus destroyed,\n  The ashes drew together, and of themselves\n  Into himself they instantly returned.\nEven thus by the great sages 'tis confessed\n  The phoenix dies, and then is born again,\n  When it approaches its five-hundredth year;\nOn herb or grain it feeds not in its life,\n  But only on tears of incense and amomum,\n  And nard and myrrh are its last winding-sheet.\nAnd as he is who falls, and knows not how,\n  By force of demons who to earth down drag him,\n  Or other oppilation that binds man,\nWhen he arises and around him looks,\n  Wholly bewildered by the mighty anguish\n  Which he has suffered, and in looking sighs;\nSuch was that sinner after he had risen.\n  Justice of God! O how severe it is,\n  That blows like these in vengeance poureth down!\nThe Guide thereafter asked him who he was;\n  Whence he replied: \"I rained from Tuscany\n  A short time since into this cruel gorge.\nA bestial life, and not a human, pleased me,\n  Even as the mule I was; I'm Vanni Fucci,\n  Beast, and Pistoia was my worthy den.\"\nAnd I unto the Guide: \"Tell him to stir not,\n  And ask what crime has thrust him here below,\n  For once a man of blood and wrath I saw him.\"\nAnd the sinner, who had heard, dissembled not,\n  But unto me directed mind and face,\n  And with a melancholy shame was painted.\nThen said: \"It pains me more that thou hast caught me\n  Amid this misery where thou seest me,\n  Than when I from the other life was taken.\nWhat thou demandest I cannot deny;\n  So low am I put down because I robbed\n  The sacristy of the fair ornaments,\nAnd falsely once 'twas laid upon another;\n  But that thou mayst not such a sight enjoy,\n  If thou shalt e'er be out of the dark places,\nThine ears to my announcement ope and hear:\n  Pistoia first of Neri groweth meagre;\n  Then Florence doth renew her men and manners;\nMars draws a vapour up from Val di Magra,\n  Which is with turbid clouds enveloped round,\n  And with impetuous and bitter tempest\nOver Campo Picen shall be the battle;\n  When it shall suddenly rend the mist asunder,\n  So that each Bianco shall thereby be smitten.\nAnd this I've said that it may give thee pain.\""

why resolve not\n  To burn thyself to ashes and so perish,\n  Since in ill-doing thou thy seed excellest?\nThrough all the sombre circles of this Hell,\n  Spirit I saw not against God so proud,\n  Not he who fell at Thebes down from the walls!\nHe fled away, and spake no further word;\n  And I beheld a Centaur full of rage\n  Come crying out: \"Where is, where is the scoffer?\"\nI do not think Maremma has so many\n  Serpents as he had all along his back,\n  As far as where our countenance begins.\nUpon the shoulders, just behind the nape,\n  With wings wide open was a dragon lying,\n  And he sets fire to all that he encounters.\nMy Master said: \"That one is Cacus, who\n  Beneath the rock upon Mount Aventine\n  Created oftentimes a lake of blood.\nHe goes not on the same road with his brothers,\n  By reason of the fraudulent theft he made\n  Of the great herd, which he had near to him;\nWhereat his tortuous actions ceased beneath\n  The mace of Hercules, who peradventure\n  Gave him a hundred, and he felt not ten.\"\nWhile he was speaking thus, he had passed by,\n  And spirits three had underneath us come,\n  Of which nor I aware was, nor my Leader,\nUntil what time they shouted: \"Who are you?\"\n  On which account our story made a halt,\n  And then we were intent on them alone.\nI did not know them; but it came to pass,\n  As it is wont to happen by some chance,\n  That one to name the other was compelled,\nExclaiming: \"Where can Cianfa have remained?\"\n  Whence I, so that the Leader might attend,\n  Upward from chin to nose my finger laid.\nIf thou art, Reader, slow now to believe\n  What I shall say, it will no marvel be,\n  For I who saw it hardly can admit it.\nAs I was holding raised on them my brows,\n  Behold! a serpent with six feet darts forth\n  In front of one, and fastens wholly on him.\nWith middle feet it bound him round the paunch,\n  And with the forward ones his arms it seized;\n  Then thrust its teeth through one cheek and the other;\nThe hindermost it stretched upon his thighs,\n  And put its tail through in between the two,\n  And up behind along the reins outspread it.\nIvy was never fastened by its barbs\n  Unto a tree so, as this horrible reptile\n  Upon the other's limbs entwined its own.\nThen they stuck close, as if of heated wax\n  They had been made, and intermixed their colour;\n  Nor one nor other seemed now what he was;\nE'en as proceedeth on before the flame\n  Upward along the paper a brown colour,\n  Which is not black as yet, and the white dies.\nThe other two looked on, and each of them\n  Cried out: \"O me, Agnello, how thou changest!\n  Behold, thou now art neither two nor one.\"\nAlready the two heads had one become,\n  When there appeared to us two figures mingled\n  Into one face, wherein the two were lost.\nOf the four lists were fashioned the two arms,\n  The thighs and legs, the belly and the chest\n  Members became that never yet were seen.\nEvery original aspect there was cancelled;\n  Two and yet none did the perverted image\n  Appear, and such departed with slow pace.\nEven as a lizard, under the great scourge\n  Of days canicular, exchanging hedge,\n  Lightning appeareth if the road it cross;\nThus did appear, coming towards the bellies\n  Of the two others, a small fiery serpent,\n  Livid and black as is a peppercorn.\nAnd in that part whereat is first received\n  Our aliment, it one of them transfixed;\n  Then downward fell in front of him extended.\nThe one transfixed looked at it, but said naught;\n  Nay, rather with feet motionless he yawned,\n  Just as if sleep or fever had assailed him.\nHe at the serpent gazed, and it at him;\n  One through the wound, the other through the mouth\n  Smoked violently, and the smoke commingled.\nHenceforth be silent Lucan, where he mentions\n  Wretched Sabellus and Nassidius,\n  And wait to hear what now shall be shot forth.\nBe silent Ovid, of Cadmus and Arethusa;\n  For if him to a snake, her to fountain,\n  Converts he fabling, that I grudge him not;\nBecause two natures never front to front\n  Has he transmuted, so that both the forms\n  To interchange their matter ready were.\nTogether they responded in such wise,\n  That to a fork the serpent cleft his tail,\n  And eke the wounded drew his feet together.\nThe legs together with the thighs themselves\n  Adhered so, that in little time the juncture\n  No sign whatever made that was apparent.\nHe with the cloven tail assumed the figure\n  The other one was losing, and his skin\n  Became elastic, and the other's hard.\nI saw the arms draw inward at the armpits,\n  And both feet of the reptile, that were short,\n  Lengthen as much as those contracted were.\nThereafter the hind feet, together twisted,\n  Became the member that a man conceals,\n  And of his own the wretch had two created.\nWhile both of them the exhalation veils\n  With a new colour, and engenders hair\n  On one of them and depilates the other,\nThe one uprose and down the other fell,\n  Though turning not away their impious lamps,\n  Underneath which each one his muzzle changed.\nHe who was standing drew it tow'rds the temples,\n  And from excess of matter, which came thither,\n  Issued the ears from out the hollow cheeks;\nWhat did not backward run and was retained\n  Of that excess made to the face a nose,\n  And the lips thickened far as was befitting.\nHe who lay prostrate thrusts his muzzle forward,\n  And backward draws the ears into his head,\n  In the same manner as the snail its horns;\nAnd so the tongue, which was entire and apt\n  For speech before, is cleft, and the bi-forked\n  In the other closes up, and the smoke ceases.\nThe soul, which to a reptile had been changed,\n  Along the valley hissing takes to flight,\n  And after him the other speaking sputters.\nThen did he turn upon him his new shoulders,\n  And said to the other: \"I'll have Buoso run,\n  Crawling as I have done, along this road.\"\nIn this way I beheld the seventh ballast\n  Shift and reshift, and here be my excuse\n  The novelty, if aught my pen transgress.\nAnd notwithstanding that mine eyes might be\n  Somewhat bewildered, and my mind dismayed,\n  They could not flee away so secretly\nBut that I plainly saw Puccio Sciancato;\n  And he it was who sole of three companions,\n  Which came in the beginning, was not changed;\nThe other was he whom thou, Gaville, weepest."

but I surmised already\n  It might be so, and already wished to ask thee\nWho is within that fire, which comes so cleft\n  At top, it seems uprising from the pyre\n  Where was Eteocles with his brother placed.\"\nHe answered me: \"Within there are tormented\n  Ulysses and Diomed, and thus together\n  They unto vengeance run as unto wrath.\nAnd there within their flame do they lament\n  The ambush of the horse, which made the door\n  Whence issued forth the Romans' gentle seed;\nTherein is wept the craft, for which being dead\n  Deidamia still deplores Achilles,\n  And pain for the Palladium there is borne.\"\n\"If they within those sparks possess the power\n  To speak,\" I said, \"thee, Master, much I pray,\n  And re-pray, that the prayer be worth a thousand,\nThat thou make no denial of awaiting\n  Until the horned flame shall hither come;\n  Thou seest that with desire I lean towards it.\"\nAnd he to me: \"Worthy is thy entreaty\n  Of much applause, and therefore I accept it;\n  But take heed that thy tongue restrain itself.\nLeave me to speak, because I have conceived\n  That which thou wishest; for they might disdain\n  Perchance, since they were Greeks, discourse of thine.\"\nWhen now the flame had come unto that point,\n  Where to my Leader it seemed time and place,\n  After this fashion did I hear him speak:\n\"O ye, who are twofold within one fire,\n  If I deserved of you, while I was living,\n  If I deserved of you or much or little\nWhen in the world I wrote the lofty verses,\n  Do not move on, but one of you declare\n  Whither, being lost, he went away to die.\"\nThen of the antique flame the greater horn,\n  Murmuring, began to wave itself about\n  Even as a flame doth which the wind fatigues.\nThereafterward, the summit to and fro\n  Moving as if it were the tongue that spake,\n  It uttered forth a voice, and said: \"When I\nFrom Circe had departed, who concealed me\n  More than a year there near unto Gaeta,\n  Or ever yet Aeneas named it so,\nNor fondness for my son, nor reverence\n  For my old father, nor the due affection\n  Which joyous should have made Penelope,\nCould overcome within me the desire\n  I had to be experienced of the world,\n  And of the vice and virtue of mankind;\nBut I put forth on the high open sea\n  With one sole ship, and that small company\n  By which I never had deserted been.\nBoth of the shores I saw as far as Spain,\n  Far as Morocco, and the isle of Sardes,\n  And the others which that sea bathes round about.\nI and my company were old and slow\n  When at that narrow passage we arrived\n  Where Hercules his landmarks set as signals,\nThat man no farther onward should adventure.\n  On the right hand behind me left I Seville,\n  And on the other already had left Ceuta.\n'O brothers, who amid a hundred thousand\n  Perils,' I said, 'have come unto the West,\n  To this so inconsiderable vigil\nWhich is remaining of your senses still\n  Be ye unwilling to deny the knowledge,\n  Following the sun, of the unpeopled world.\nConsider ye the seed from which ye sprang;\n  Ye were not made to live like unto brutes,\n  But for pursuit of virtue and of knowledge.'\nSo eager did I render my companions,\n  With this brief exhortation, for the voyage,\n  That then I hardly could have held them back.\nAnd having turned our stern unto the morning,\n  We of the oars made wings for our mad flight,\n  Evermore gaining on the larboard side.\nAlready all the stars of the other pole\n  The night beheld, and ours so very low\n  It did not rise above the ocean floor.\nFive times rekindled and as many quenched\n  Had been the splendour underneath the moon,\n  Since we had entered into the deep pass,\nWhen there appeared to us a mountain, dim\n  From distance, and it seemed to me so high\n  As I had never any one beheld.\nJoyful were we, and soon it turned to weeping;\n  For out of the new land a whirlwind rose,\n  And smote upon the fore part of the ship.\nThree times it made her whirl with all the waters,\n  At the fourth time it made the stern uplift,\n  And the prow downward go, as pleased Another,\nUntil the sea above us closed again.\""

and it would have bestead me;\nThe Leader of the modern Pharisees\n  Having a war near unto Lateran,\n  And not with Saracens nor with the Jews,\nFor each one of his enemies was Christian,\n  And none of them had been to conquer Acre,\n  Nor merchandising in the Sultan's land,\nNor the high office, nor the sacred orders,\n  In him regarded, nor in me that cord\n  Which used to make those girt with it more meagre;\nBut even as Constantine sought out Sylvester\n  To cure his leprosy, within Soracte,\n  So this one sought me out as an adept\nTo cure him of the fever of his pride.\n  Counsel he asked of me, and I was silent,\n  Because his words appeared inebriate.\nAnd then he said: 'Be not thy heart afraid;\n  Henceforth I thee absolve; and thou instruct me\n  How to raze Palestrina to the ground.\nHeaven have I power to lock and to unlock,\n  As thou dost know; therefore the keys are two,\n  The which my predecessor held not dear.'\nThen urged me on his weighty arguments\n  There, where my silence was the worst advice;\n  And said I: 'Father, since thou washest me\nOf that sin into which I now must fall,\n  The promise long with the fulfilment short\n  Will make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.'\nFrancis came afterward, when I was dead,\n  For me; but one of the black Cherubim\n  Said to him: 'Take him not; do me no wrong;\nHe must come down among my servitors,\n  Because he gave the fraudulent advice\n  From which time forth I have been at his hair;\nFor who repents not cannot be absolved,\n  Nor can one both repent and will at once,\n  Because of the contradiction which consents not.'\nO miserable me! how I did shudder\n  When he seized on me, saying: 'Peradventure\n  Thou didst not think that I was a logician!'\nHe bore me unto Minos, who entwined\n  Eight times his tail about his stubborn back,\n  And after he had bitten it in great rage,\nSaid: 'Of the thievish fire a culprit this;'\n  Wherefore, here where thou seest, am I lost,\n  And vested thus in going I bemoan me.\"\nWhen it had thus completed its recital,\n  The flame departed uttering lamentations,\n  Writhing and flapping its sharp-pointed horn.\nOnward we passed, both I and my Conductor,\n  Up o'er the crag above another arch,\n  Which the moat covers, where is paid the fee\nBy those who, sowing discord, win their burden."

but he had pinioned close\n  Behind the right arm, and in front the other,\nWith chains, that held him so begirt about\n  From the neck down, that on the part uncovered\n  It wound itself as far as the fifth gyre.\n\"This proud one wished to make experiment\n  Of his own power against the Supreme Jove,\"\n  My Leader said, \"whence he has such a guerdon.\nEphialtes is his name; he showed great prowess.\n  What time the giants terrified the gods;\n  The arms he wielded never more he moves.\"\nAnd I to him: \"If possible, I should wish\n  That of the measureless Briareus\n  These eyes of mine might have experience.\"\nWhence he replied: \"Thou shalt behold Antaeus\n  Close by here, who can speak and is unbound,\n  Who at the bottom of all crime shall place us.\nMuch farther yon is he whom thou wouldst see,\n  And he is bound, and fashioned like to this one,\n  Save that he seems in aspect more ferocious.\"\nThere never was an earthquake of such might\n  That it could shake a tower so violently,\n  As Ephialtes suddenly shook himself.\nThen was I more afraid of death than ever,\n  For nothing more was needful than the fear,\n  If I had not beheld the manacles.\nThen we proceeded farther in advance,\n  And to Antaeus came, who, full five ells\n  Without the head, forth issued from the cavern.\n\"O thou, who in the valley fortunate,\n  Which Scipio the heir of glory made,\n  When Hannibal turned back with all his hosts,\nOnce brought'st a thousand lions for thy prey,\n  And who, hadst thou been at the mighty war\n  Among thy brothers, some it seems still think\nThe sons of Earth the victory would have gained:\n  Place us below, nor be disdainful of it,\n  There where the cold doth lock Cocytus up.\nMake us not go to Tityus nor Typhoeus;\n  This one can give of that which here is longed for;\n  Therefore stoop down, and do not curl thy lip.\nStill in the world can he restore thy fame;\n  Because he lives, and still expects long life,\n  If to itself Grace call him not untimely.\"\nSo said the Master; and in haste the other\n  His hands extended and took up my Guide,--\n  Hands whose great pressure Hercules once felt.\nVirgilius, when he felt himself embraced,\n  Said unto me: \"Draw nigh, that I may take thee;\"\n  Then of himself and me one bundle made.\nAs seems the Carisenda, to behold\n  Beneath the leaning side, when goes a cloud\n  Above it so that opposite it hangs;\nSuch did Antaeus seem to me, who stood\n  Watching to see him stoop, and then it was\n  I could have wished to go some other way.\nBut lightly in the abyss, which swallows up\n  Judas with Lucifer, he put us down;\n  Nor thus bowed downward made he there delay,\nBut, as a mast does in a ship, uprose."

and how is this one fixed\n  Thus upside down? and how in such short time\n  From eve to morn has the sun made his transit?\"\nAnd he to me: \"Thou still imaginest\n  Thou art beyond the centre, where I grasped\n  The hair of the fell worm, who mines the world.\nThat side thou wast, so long as I descended;\n  When round I turned me, thou didst pass the point\n  To which things heavy draw from every side,\nAnd now beneath the hemisphere art come\n  Opposite that which overhangs the vast\n  Dry-land, and 'neath whose cope was put to death\nThe Man who without sin was born and lived.\n  Thou hast thy feet upon the little sphere\n  Which makes the other face of the Judecca.\nHere it is morn when it is evening there;\n  And he who with his hair a stairway made us\n  Still fixed remaineth as he was before.\nUpon this side he fell down out of heaven;\n  And all the land, that whilom here emerged,\n  For fear of him made of the sea a veil,\nAnd came to our hemisphere; and peradventure\n  To flee from him, what on this side appears\n  Left the place vacant here, and back recoiled.\"\nA place there is below, from Beelzebub\n  As far receding as the tomb extends,\n  Which not by sight is known, but by the sound\nOf a small rivulet, that there descendeth\n  Through chasm within the stone, which it has gnawed\n  With course that winds about and slightly falls.\nThe Guide and I into that hidden road\n  Now entered, to return to the bright world;\n  And without care of having any rest\nWe mounted up, he first and I the second,\n  Till I beheld through a round aperture\n  Some of the beauteous things that Heaven doth bear;\nThence we came forth to rebehold the stars."
