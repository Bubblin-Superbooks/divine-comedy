And that of which the Savio bathes the flank,
  Even as it lies between the plain and mountain,
  Lives between tyranny and a free state.

  In its own fashion, the sharp point it moved
  This way and that, and then gave forth such breath:

  To one who to the world would e'er return,
  This flame without more flickering would stand still;
But inasmuch as never from this depth
  Did any one return, if I hear true,
  Without the fear of infamy I answer,
I was a man of arms, then Cordelier,
  Believing thus begirt to make amends;
