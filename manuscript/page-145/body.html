Even such became I at those proffered words;
  But shame in me his menaces produced,
  Which maketh servant strong before good master.
I seated me upon those monstrous shoulders;
  I wished to say, and yet the voice came not
  As I believed, "Take heed that thou embrace me."
But he, who other times had rescued me
  In other peril, soon as I had mounted,
  Within his arms encircled and sustained me,
And said: "Now, Geryon, bestir thyself;
  The circles large, and the descent be little;
  Think of the novel burden which thou hast."
Even as the little vessel shoves from shore,
  Backward, still backward, so he thence withdrew;
  And when he wholly felt himself afloat,
There where his breast had been he turned his tail,
  And that extended like an eel he moved,
