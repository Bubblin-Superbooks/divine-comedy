<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>So from the precipice's base did crags Project, which intersected dikes and moats, Unto the well that truncates and collects them.</p><p>Within this place, down shaken from the back Of Geryon, we found us; and the Poet Held to the left, and I moved on behind.</p><p>Upon my right hand I beheld new anguish, New torments, and new wielders of the lash, Wherewith the foremost Bolgia was replete.</p><p>Down at the bottom were the sinners naked; This side the middle came they facing us, Beyond it, with us, but with greater steps;</p><p>Even as the Romans, for the mighty host, The year of Jubilee, upon the bridge, Have chosen a mode to pass the people over;</p><p>For all upon one side towards the Castle Their faces have, and go unto St. Peter's; On the other side they go towards the Mountain.</p></div> </div>
