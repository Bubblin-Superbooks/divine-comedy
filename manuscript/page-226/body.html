<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>And following the solitary path Among the rocks and ridges of the crag, The foot without the hand sped not at all.</p><p>Then sorrowed I, and sorrow now again, When I direct my mind to what I saw, And more my genius curb than I am wont,</p><p>That it may run not unless virtue guide it; So that if some good star, or better thing, Have given me good, I may myself not grudge it.</p><p>As many as the hind (who on the hill Rests at the time when he who lights the world His countenance keeps least concealed from us,</p><p>While as the fly gives place unto the gnat) Seeth the glow-worms down along the valley, Perchance there where he ploughs and makes his vintage;</p><p>With flames as manifold resplendent all Was the eighth Bolgia, as I grew aware As soon as I was where the depth appeared.</p></div> </div>
