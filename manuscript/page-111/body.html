To tell us in what way the soul is bound
  Within these knots; and tell us, if thou canst,
  If any from such members e'er is freed."
Then blew the trunk amain, and afterward
  The wind was into such a voice converted:
  "With brevity shall be replied to you.
When the exasperated soul abandons
  The body whence it rent itself away,
  Minos consigns it to the seventh abyss.
It falls into the forest, and no part
  Is chosen for it; but where Fortune hurls it,
  There like a grain of spelt it germinates.
It springs a sapling, and a forest tree;
  The Harpies, feeding then upon its leaves,
  Do pain create, and for the pain an outlet.
Like others for our spoils shall we return;
  But not that any one may them revest,
