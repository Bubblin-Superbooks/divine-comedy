  Beholding my Conductor backward turn,
  Sooner repressed within him his new colour.

  Because the eye could not conduct him far
  Through the black air, and through the heavy fog.
"Still it behoveth us to win the fight,"
  Began he; "Else. . .Such offered us herself. . .
  O how I long that some one here arrive!"

  That they were words quite different from the first;
But none the less his saying gave me fear,
  Because I carried out the broken phrase,
  Perhaps to a worse meaning than he</pre></div> </div>
