  Before the pity of those two relations,
  Which utterly with sadness had confused me,
New torments I behold, and new tormented
  Around me, whichsoever way I move,
  And whichsoever way I turn, and gaze.
In the third circle am I of the rain
  Eternal, maledict, and cold, and heavy;
  Its law and quality are never new.
Huge hail, and water sombre-hued, and snow,
  Athwart the tenebrous air pour down amain;
  Noisome the earth is, that receiveth this.
Cerberus, monster cruel and uncouth,
  With his three gullets like a dog is barking
  Over the people that are there</pre></div> </div>
