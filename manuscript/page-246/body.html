We step by step went onward without speech,
  Gazing upon and listening to the sick
  Who had not strength enough to lift their bodies.
I saw two sitting leaned against each other,
  As leans in heating platter against platter,
  From head to foot bespotted o'er with scabs;
And never saw I plied a currycomb
  By stable-boy for whom his master waits,
  Or him who keeps awake unwillingly,
As every one was plying fast the bite
  Of nails upon himself, for the great rage
  Of itching which no other succour had.
And the nails downward with them dragged the scab,
  In fashion as a knife the scales of bream,
  Or any other fish that has them largest.
"O thou, that with thy fingers dost dismail thee,"
  Began my Leader unto one of them,
