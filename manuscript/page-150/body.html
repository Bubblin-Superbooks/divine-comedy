This side and that, along the livid stone
  Beheld I horned demons with great scourges,
  Who cruelly were beating them behind.
Ah me! how they did make them lift their legs
  At the first blows! and sooth not any one
  The second waited for, nor for the third.
While I was going on, mine eyes by one
  Encountered were; and straight I said: "Already
  With sight of this one I am not unfed."
Therefore I stayed my feet to make him out,
  And with me the sweet Guide came to a stand,
  And to my going somewhat back assented;
And he, the scourged one, thought to hide himself,
  Lowering his face, but little it availed him;
  For said I: "Thou that castest down thine eyes,
If false are not the features which thou bearest,
  Thou art Venedico Caccianimico;
