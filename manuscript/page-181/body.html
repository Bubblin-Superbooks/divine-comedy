Ever upon the pitch was my intent,
  To see the whole condition of that Bolgia,
  And of the people who therein were burned.
Even as the dolphins, when they make a sign
  To mariners by arching of the back,
  That they should counsel take to save their vessel,
Thus sometimes, to alleviate his pain,
  One of the sinners would display his back,
  And in less time conceal it than it lightens.
As on the brink of water in a ditch
  The frogs stand only with their muzzles out,
  So that they hide their feet and other bulk,
So upon every side the sinners stood;
  But ever as Barbariccia near them came,
  Thus underneath the boiling they withdrew.
I saw, and still my heart doth shudder at it,
  One waiting thus, even as it comes to pass
