<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This side and that, along the livid stone Beheld I horned demons with great scourges, Who cruelly were beating them behind.</p><p>Ah me! how they did make them lift their legs At the first blows! and sooth not any one The second waited for, nor for the third.</p><p>While I was going on, mine eyes by one Encountered were; and straight I said: "Already With sight of this one I am not unfed."</p><p>Therefore I stayed my feet to make him out, And with me the sweet Guide came to a stand, And to my going somewhat back assented;</p><p>And he, the scourged one, thought to hide himself, Lowering his face, but little it availed him; For said I: "Thou that castest down thine eyes,</p><p>If false are not the features which thou bearest, Thou art Venedico Caccianimico; But what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces?"</p></div> </div>
