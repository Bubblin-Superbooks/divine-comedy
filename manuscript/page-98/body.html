<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Canto Xii</h3><pre class=" stretch-last-line">The place where to descend the bank we came
  Was alpine, and from what was there, moreover,
  Of such a kind that every eye would shun it.
Such as that ruin is which in the flank
  Smote, on this side of Trent, the Adige,
  Either by earthquake or by failing stay,
For from the mountain's top, from which it moved,
  Unto the plain the cliff is shattered so,
  Some path 'twould give to him who was above;
Even such was the descent of that ravine,
  And on the border of the broken chasm
  The infamy of Crete was stretched along,
Who was conceived in the fictitious cow;
  And when he us beheld, he bit himself,
  Even as one whom anger racks</pre></div> </div>
