I do not know if I were here too bold,
  That him I answered only in this metre:
  "I pray thee tell me now how great a treasure
Our Lord demanded of Saint Peter first,
  Before he put the keys into his keeping?
  Truly he nothing asked but 'Follow me.'
Nor Peter nor the rest asked of Matthias
  Silver or gold, when he by lot was chosen
  Unto the place the guilty soul had lost.
Therefore stay here, for thou art justly punished,
  And keep safe guard o'er the ill-gotten money,
  Which caused thee to be valiant against Charles.
And were it not that still forbids it me
  The reverence for the keys superlative
  Thou hadst in keeping in the gladsome life,
I would make use of words more grievous still;
  Because your avarice afflicts the world,
