"O thou, that to this dolorous hostelry
  Comest," said Minos to me, when he saw me,
  Leaving the practice of so great an office,

  Let not the portal's amplitude deceive thee."
  And unto him my Guide: "Why criest thou too?

  It is so willed there where is power to do
  That which is willed; and ask no further question."

  Audible unto me; now am I come
  There where much lamentation strikes upon me.

  Which bellows as the sea does in a tempest,
  If by opposing winds 't is combated.
The infernal hurricane that never rests
  Hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine;
