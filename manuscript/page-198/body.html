<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Canto Xxiv</h3><pre class=" stretch-last-line">In that part of the youthful year wherein
  The Sun his locks beneath Aquarius tempers,
  And now the nights draw near to half the day,
What time the hoar-frost copies on the ground
  The outward semblance of her sister white,
  But little lasts the temper of her pen,
The husbandman, whose forage faileth him,
  Rises, and looks, and seeth the champaign
  All gleaming white, whereat he beats his flank,
Returns in doors, and up and down laments,
  Like a poor wretch, who knows not what to do;
  Then he returns and hope revives again,
Seeing the world has changed its countenance
  In little time, and takes his shepherd's crook,
  And forth the little lambs to pasture</pre></div> </div>
