Not an Amen could possibly be said
  So rapidly as they had disappeared;
  Wherefore the Master deemed best to depart.
I followed him, and little had we gone,
  Before the sound of water was so near us,
  That speaking we should hardly have been heard.
Even as that stream which holdeth its own course
  The first from Monte Veso tow'rds the East,
  Upon the left-hand slope of Apennine,
Which is above called Acquacheta, ere
  It down descendeth into its low bed,
  And at Forli is vacant of that name,
Reverberates there above San Benedetto
  From Alps, by falling at a single leap,
  Where for a thousand there were room enough;
Thus downward from a bank precipitate,
  We found resounding that dark-tinted water,
