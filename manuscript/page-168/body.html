Sitteth Peschiera, fortress fair and strong,
  To front the Brescians and the Bergamasks,
  Where round about the bank descendeth lowest.
There of necessity must fall whatever
  In bosom of Benaco cannot stay,
  And grows a river down through verdant pastures.
Soon as the water doth begin to run,
  No more Benaco is it called, but Mincio,
  Far as Governo, where it falls in Po.
Not far it runs before it finds a plain
  In which it spreads itself, and makes it marshy,
  And oft 'tis wont in summer to be sickly.
Passing that way the virgin pitiless
  Land in the middle of the fen descried,
  Untilled and naked of inhabitants;
There to escape all human intercourse,
  She with her servants stayed, her arts to practise
