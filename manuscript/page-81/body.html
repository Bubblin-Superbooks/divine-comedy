Within we entered without any contest;
  And I, who inclination had to see
  What the condition such a fortress holds,
Soon as I was within, cast round mine eye,
  And see on every hand an ample plain,
  Full of distress and torment terrible.
Even as at Arles, where stagnant grows the Rhone,
  Even as at Pola near to the Quarnaro,
  That shuts in Italy and bathes its borders,
The sepulchres make all the place uneven;
  So likewise did they there on every side,
  Saving that there the manner was more bitter;
For flames between the sepulchres were scattered,
  By which they so intensely heated were,
  That iron more so asks not any art.
All of their coverings uplifted were,
  And from them issued forth such dire laments,
