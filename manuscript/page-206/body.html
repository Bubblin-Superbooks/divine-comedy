<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Canto Xxiv ```</h3><p>In that part of the youthful year wherein The Sun his locks beneath Aquarius tempers, And now the nights draw near to half the day,</p><p>What time the hoar-frost copies on the ground The outward semblance of her sister white, But little lasts the temper of her pen,</p><p>The husbandman, whose forage faileth him, Rises, and looks, and seeth the champaign All gleaming white, whereat he beats his flank,</p><p>Returns in doors, and up and down laments, Like a poor wretch, who knows not what to do; Then he returns and hope revives again,</p><p>Seeing the world has changed its countenance In little time, and takes his shepherd's crook, And forth the little lambs to pasture drives.</p></div> </div>
