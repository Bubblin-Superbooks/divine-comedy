<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent stretch-last-line">Here meet together out of every land;
And ready are they to pass o'er the river,
  Because celestial Justice spurs them on,
  So that their fear is turned into desire.
This way there never passes a good soul;
  And hence if Charon doth complain of thee,
  Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports."
This being finished, all the dusk champaign
  Trembled so violently, that of that terror
  The recollection bathes me still with sweat.
The land of tears gave forth a blast of wind,
  And fulminated a vermilion light,
  Which overmastered in me every sense,
And as a man whom sleep hath seized I fell.```
