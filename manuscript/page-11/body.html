And never moved she from before my face,
  Nay, rather did impede so much my way,
  That many times I to return had turned.
The time was the beginning of the morning,
  And up the sun was mounting with those stars
  That with him were, what time the Love Divine
At first in motion set those beauteous things;
  So were to me occasion of good hope,
  The variegated skin of that wild beast,
The hour of time, and the delicious season;
  But not so much, that did not give me fear
  A lion's aspect which appeared to me.
He seemed as if against me he were coming
  With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger,
  So that it seemed the air was afraid of him;
And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings
  Seemed to be laden in her meagreness,
