<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>For Guglielmo Borsier, who is in torment With us of late, and goes there with his comrades, Doth greatly mortify us with his words."</p><p>"The new inhabitants and the sudden gains, Pride and extravagance have in thee engendered, Florence, so that thou weep'st thereat already!"</p><p>In this wise I exclaimed with face uplifted; And the three, taking that for my reply, Looked at each other, as one looks at truth.</p><p>"If other times so little it doth cost thee," Replied they all, "to satisfy another, Happy art thou, thus speaking at thy will!</p><p>Therefore, if thou escape from these dark places, And come to rebehold the beauteous stars, When it shall pleasure thee to say, 'I was,'</p><p>See that thou speak of us unto the people." Then they broke up the wheel, and in their flight It seemed as if their agile legs were wings.</p></div> </div>
