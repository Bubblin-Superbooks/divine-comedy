Thy fortune so much honour doth reserve thee,
  One party and the other shall be hungry
  For thee; but far from goat shall be the grass.
Their litter let the beasts of Fesole
  Make of themselves, nor let them touch the plant,
  If any still upon their dunghill rise,
In which may yet revive the consecrated
  Seed of those Romans, who remained there when
  The nest of such great malice it became."
"If my entreaty wholly were fulfilled,"
  Replied I to him, "not yet would you be
  In banishment from human nature placed;
For in my mind is fixed, and touches now
  My heart the dear and good paternal image
  Of you, when in the world from hour to hour
You taught me how a man becomes eternal;
  And how much I am grateful, while I live
