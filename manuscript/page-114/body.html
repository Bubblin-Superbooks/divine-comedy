Gather them up beneath the dismal bush;
  I of that city was which to the Baptist
  Changed its first patron, wherefore he for this
Forever with his art will make it sad.

  Some glimpses of him are remaining still,
Those citizens, who afterwards rebuilt it
  Upon the ashes left by Attila,
  In vain had caused their labour to be done.
Of my own house I made myself a gibbet."</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
