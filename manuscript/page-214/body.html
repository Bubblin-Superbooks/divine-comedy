He who was standing drew it tow'rds the temples,
  And from excess of matter, which came thither,
  Issued the ears from out the hollow cheeks;

  Of that excess made to the face a nose,
  And the lips thickened far as was befitting.

  And backward draws the ears into his head,
  In the same manner as the snail its horns;
And so the tongue, which was entire and apt
  For speech before, is cleft, and the bi-forked
  In the other closes up, and the smoke ceases.

  Along the valley hissing takes to flight,
  And after him the other speaking sputters.

  And said to the other: "I'll have Buoso run,
