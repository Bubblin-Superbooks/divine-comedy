To me less ample seemed they not, nor greater
  Than those that in my beautiful Saint John
  Are fashioned for the place of the baptisers,
And one of which, not many years ago,
  I broke for some one, who was drowning in it;
  Be this a seal all men to undeceive.
Out of the mouth of each one there protruded
  The feet of a transgressor, and the legs
  Up to the calf, the rest within remained.
In all of them the soles were both on fire;
  Wherefore the joints so violently quivered,
  They would have snapped asunder withes and bands.
Even as the flame of unctuous things is wont
  To move upon the outer surface only,
  So likewise was it there from heel to point.
"Master, who is that one who writhes himself,
  More than his other comrades quivering,"
