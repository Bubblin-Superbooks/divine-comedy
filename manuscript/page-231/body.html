On the right hand behind me left I Seville, And on the other already had left Ceuta.</p><p>'O brothers, who amid a hundred thousand Perils,' I said, 'have come unto the West, To this so inconsiderable vigil</p><p>Which is remaining of your senses still Be ye unwilling to deny the knowledge, Following the sun, of the unpeopled world.</p><p>Consider ye the seed from which ye sprang; Ye were not made to live like unto brutes, But for pursuit of virtue and of knowledge.'</p><p>So eager did I render my companions, With this brief exhortation, for the voyage, That then I hardly could have held them back.</p></div> </div>
