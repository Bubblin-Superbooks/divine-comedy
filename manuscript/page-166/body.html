Amphiaraus?  Why dost leave the war?'
  And downward ceased he not to fall amain
  As far as Minos, who lays hold on all.
See, he has made a bosom of his shoulders!
  Because he wished to see too far before him
  Behind he looks, and backward goes his way:
Behold Tiresias, who his semblance changed,
  When from a male a female he became,
  His members being all of them transformed;
And afterwards was forced to strike once more
  The two entangled serpents with his rod,
  Ere he could have again his manly plumes.
That Aruns is, who backs the other's belly,
  Who in the hills of Luni, there where grubs
  The Carrarese who houses underneath,
Among the marbles white a cavern had
  For his abode; whence to behold the stars
