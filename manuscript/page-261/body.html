As, when the fog is vanishing away,
  Little by little doth the sight refigure
  Whate'er the mist that crowds the air conceals,
So, piercing through the dense and darksome air,
  More and more near approaching tow'rd the verge,
  My error fled, and fear came over me;
Because as on its circular parapets
  Montereggione crowns itself with towers,
  E'en thus the margin which surrounds the well
With one half of their bodies turreted
  The horrible giants, whom Jove menaces
  E'en now from out the heavens when he thunders.
And I of one already saw the face,
  Shoulders, and breast, and great part of the belly,
  And down along his sides both of the arms.
Certainly Nature, when she left the making
  Of animals like these, did well indeed,
