<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Vengeance of God, O how much oughtest thou By each one to be dreaded, who doth read That which was manifest unto mine eyes!</p><p>Of naked souls beheld I many herds, Who all were weeping very miserably, And over them seemed set a law diverse.</p><p>Supine upon the ground some folk were lying; And some were sitting all drawn up together, And others went about continually.</p><p>Those who were going round were far the more, And those were less who lay down to their torment, But had their tongues more loosed to lamentation.</p><p>O'er all the sand-waste, with a gradual fall, Were raining down dilated flakes of fire, As of the snow on Alp without a wind.</p><p>As Alexander, in those torrid parts Of India, beheld upon his host Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground.</p></div> </div>
