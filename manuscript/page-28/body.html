And he to me: "This miserable mode
  Maintain the melancholy souls of those
  Who lived withouten infamy or praise.
Commingled are they with that caitiff choir
  Of Angels, who have not rebellious been,
  Nor faithful were to God, but were for self.
The heavens expelled them, not to be less fair;
  Nor them the nethermore abyss receives,
  For glory none the damned would have from them."
And I: "O Master, what so grievous is
  To these, that maketh them lament so sore?"
  He answered: "I will tell thee very briefly.
These have no longer any hope of death;
  And this blind life of theirs is so debased,
  They envious are of every other fate.
No fame of them the world permits to be;
  Misericord and Justice both disdain them.
