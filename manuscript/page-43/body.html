  Down to the second, that less space begirds,
  And so much greater dole, that goads to wailing.
There standeth Minos horribly, and snarls;
  Examines the transgressions at the entrance;
  Judges, and sends according as he girds him.
I say, that when the spirit evil-born
  Cometh before him, wholly it confesses;
  And this discriminator of transgressions
Seeth what place in Hell is meet for it;
  Girds himself with his tail as many times
  As grades he wishes it should be thrust down.
Always before him many of them stand;
  They go by turns each one unto the judgment;
  They speak, and hear, and then are downward</pre></div> </div>
