  Wholly of stone and of an iron colour,

  There yawns a well exceeding wide and deep,
  Of which its place the structure will recount.

  Between the well and foot of the high, hard bank,
  And has distinct in valleys ten its bottom.
As where for the protection of the walls

  And as about such strongholds from their gates
  Unto the outer bank are little</pre></div> </div>
