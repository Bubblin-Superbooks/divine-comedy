  We went, the one in front, the other after,
  As go the Minor Friars along their way.
Upon the fable of Aesop was directed
  My thought, by reason of the present quarrel,
  Where he has spoken of the frog and mouse;
For 'mo' and 'issa' are not more alike
  Than this one is to that, if well we couple
  End and beginning with a steadfast mind.
And even as one thought from another springs,
  So afterward from that was born another,
  Which the first fear within me double made.
Thus did I ponder: "These on our account
  Are laughed to scorn, with injury and scoff
  So great, that much I think it must annoy</pre></div> </div>
