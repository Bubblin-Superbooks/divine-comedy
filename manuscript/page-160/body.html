<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent stretch-last-line">Know that I vested was with the great mantle;
And truly was I son of the She-bear,
  So eager to advance the cubs, that wealth
  Above, and here myself, I pocketed.
Beneath my head the others are dragged down
  Who have preceded me in simony,
  Flattened along the fissure of the rock.
Below there I shall likewise fall, whenever
  That one shall come who I believed thou wast,
  What time the sudden question I proposed.
But longer I my feet already toast,
  And here have been in this way upside down,
  Than he will planted stay with reddened feet;
For after him shall come of fouler deed
  From tow'rds the west a Pastor without law,
  Such as befits to cover him and me.
New Jason will he be, of whom we read
  In Maccabees; and as his king was pliant,
