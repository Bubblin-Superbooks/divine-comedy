That, by effect of his malicious thoughts,
  Trusting in him I was made prisoner,
  And after put to death, I need not say;

  Hunting the wolf and whelps upon the mountain
  For which the Pisans cannot Lucca see.
With sleuth-hounds gaunt, and eager, and well trained,
  Gualandi with Sismondi and Lanfianchi
