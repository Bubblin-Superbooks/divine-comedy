<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Sitteth Peschiera, fortress fair and strong, To front the Brescians and the Bergamasks, Where round about the bank descendeth lowest.</p><p>There of necessity must fall whatever In bosom of Benaco cannot stay, And grows a river down through verdant pastures.</p><p>Soon as the water doth begin to run, No more Benaco is it called, but Mincio, Far as Governo, where it falls in Po.</p><p>Not far it runs before it finds a plain In which it spreads itself, and makes it marshy, And oft 'tis wont in summer to be sickly.</p><p>Passing that way the virgin pitiless Land in the middle of the fen descried, Untilled and naked of inhabitants;</p><p>There to escape all human intercourse, She with her servants stayed, her arts to practise And lived, and left her empty body there.</p></div> </div>
