And following the solitary path
  Among the rocks and ridges of the crag,
  The foot without the hand sped not at all.
Then sorrowed I, and sorrow now again,
  When I direct my mind to what I saw,
  And more my genius curb than I am wont,
That it may run not unless virtue guide it;
  So that if some good star, or better thing,
  Have given me good, I may myself not grudge it.
As many as the hind (who on the hill
  Rests at the time when he who lights the world
  His countenance keeps least concealed from us,
While as the fly gives place unto the gnat)
  Seeth the glow-worms down along the valley,
  Perchance there where he ploughs and makes his vintage;
With flames as manifold resplendent all
  Was the eighth Bolgia, as I grew aware
