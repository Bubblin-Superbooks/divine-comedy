It of itself made to itself a lamp,
  And they were two in one, and one in two;
  How that can be, He knows who so ordains it.
When it was come close to the bridge's foot,
  It lifted high its arm with all the head,
  To bring more closely unto us its words,
Which were: "Behold now the sore penalty,
  Thou, who dost breathing go the dead beholding;
  Behold if any be as great as this.
And so that thou may carry news of me,
  Know that Bertram de Born am I, the same
  Who gave to the Young King the evil comfort.
I made the father and the son rebellious;
  Achitophel not more with Absalom
  And David did with his accursed goadings.
Because I parted persons so united,
  Parted do I now bear my brain, alas!
